And 10 years from now, we'll say the current champs fought in weaker eras.

And guess what? That generation will be correct as well.

Sports evolve. That's not a controversial take.

They fought in the steroid era so definitely not weaker

See i actually thought like this for the first two years I watched the sport then I went back and watched old events and holy fuck this is an L take. It's seems less competitive because when the athelets are current names hold more value. Whereas once guys retire, only the best of the best get remembered. So we look at some of the guys old champs beat and think "hmm that's not very impressive". Like you think guys that are widely considered good but aren't amazing are going to be remembered 5 years after they retire? You think the jared cannoiers, beniel dariush's etc of the league, guys that RIGHT NOW seem like legit good wins if you beat them are going to be seen the same way when they're retired? That's how we look at old names now. Theses guys WERE elite, its just that only the MOST ELITE of each generation really get remembered correctly in terms of skill. Everyone else just kinda gets the "oh I've only heard his name a few times so he's probably not anything special" even if they were the real deal at the time.

Its also alot easier to judge fighters harshly once their career has already passed(i.e in terms of how well wins "age") then it is while there still fighting. Guys that seem like good wins for champs now could look like very bad wins by the end of their careers.

Tl;Dr dont be like me, do a bit of research and you'll realize this is an L ass take

They did fight in weaker eras but I think both in their primes would still be great in todays era

I think they should be higher cuz coaching/training partners weren’t that advanced like today’s times.

See how stupid that sounds

They beat everything that was thrown at them for years not their fault they were just THAT good. Ahead of their time and we’re top notch. Honestly George’s had the best retirement. On top both times
