Shara Bullet: "I want to meet Marvin Vettori. I saw him in training at Tiger. He is high in the ratings, plus he is a European, and among the Europeans he is the highest in the rating. If I beat him, I will be number one in Europe, not just in Russia. So next fight with Marvin Vettori, no problem."

    Send him to Ukraine. That'll show him he's not the best in Europe. A lot of Russians have learnt that the hard way

    Unless next fight he means a hellishly outstanding slaughter now and later Vettori he can f himself. Still it would be very weird to give him Marvin on a second fight
