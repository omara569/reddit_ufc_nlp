If he didn’t punch fuck and dethrone Izzy , then Usman probably  wouldn’t have moved up to make his middleweight debutShoutout to Sean for allowing the UFC 294 Co-main event to happen 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼

Usman eyeing that Strickland rematch for sure made him sack up to fight Khamzat.

What if Usman wins and then beats Sean and become the middleweight champ and Izzy beats DDP, will he fight Izzy?

I don't think he can beat Sean.

Izzy represents china now so it shouldn't be a problem

100%, Usman would never take this ridiculous fight at 185 unless Dana slips in some special benefits.

Probably guaranteed a 7 figure cheque for 15 minutes of work + a guaranteed title shot against Sean Strickland. It's a pretty good deal if u think about it.

Everyone in MW is queueing up for their shot, and Uncle Dana is handing out golden ticket to the top because keeping the event alive and pleasing the Abu Dhabi investors is more important

Not really Dricus doesn’t have any leverage anymore because Izzy lost. There was a big appeal in seeing Dricus fight Izzy for the belt not for the belt. Khamzat is Dana’s next cash cow and he has been waiting on Khamzat to get back in the cage so why wouldn’t he get a title shot

Y’all really need to stop deepthroating Strickland man once he loses he will have zero fans and that’s the reality

DeSean had fans before 293. Now he just has more fans. Not sure a dude who so one-sidedly beat Izzy is going to just drop off the face of the earth if he loses a fight
