Officially one month since UFC 293… Was this the end of Izzy’s prime or just a bad night?

    Not the end of his prime or a bad night because Izzy looked like and fought like he normally does, it was simply a bad stylistic matchup for Izzy.

    It’s absolutely wild people are doing mental gymnastics to explain how Sean Strickland negated adesanya for 5 straight rounds. We all saw the same fight, that mma Philly shell was too oppressive for Izzy to counter strike through as Sean plodded forward with his hyper flinching. “Oh you want to feint? No problem I will react every single time so nothing gets through.”

    I agree but damn what happened to that I’m prepared to die mentality? It looked like he wanted no parts of Strickland I just thought Izzy had a lil more dog in him

    Neither. Just a bad matchup. Looping counter strikes are not great against straight punches from someone who doesn’t overextend themselves. Throwing one kick at a time against an elite defensive fighter isn’t very effective.
  
    Izzy has the technical tools to win this and you could see he landed well at the end of 3+ strike combos. I just don’t think it would be easy for him to adapt and put together a complete fight offensively throwing combos and maintaining distance by pushing Strickland back. It is kind of funny that he calls himself The Last Stylebender.

    I think he underestimated his opponent. Got caught really bad, couldn't execute his game plan and had no plan B in place for if exactly what happend happend.

    As a fan of the sport I’m happy Strickland won and I give him 100% credit for that win… It might just be a bad match up and Strickland could win 10 times out of 10 but from what I saw that night something seemed off with Izzy he honestly looked like he didn’t wanna be there but maybe Strickland is just that damn good Idk just gotta wait and see how this plays out that’s the beauty of this sport we all love

    Basically, this. I'm not taking away from Strickland, but a lot of this sub just has the weirdest level of hate for Adesanya.
  
    Every time he fights, the sub turns into a shithole of hate posts. You have guys who genuinely believe he's the worst person ever.. in the face of fighters who do drugs, beat/assault women, fight old people, and have verifiablely popped for PEDs.
  
    So, while Sean did great. There are people who genuinely hate Adesanya to the point where they'll pass what was clearly an off night (which happens to every fighter) as a normal day.
  
    Like that looping left hook that Sean countered. That is not something Adesanya throws without some kind of setup for it.. and I don't remember seeing him throw it up against the fence.. where there's not much space for him to lean back..
  
    I was less surprised that Sean countered it.. and more surprised Adesanya threw it from that position
