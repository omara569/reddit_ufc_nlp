Alexander Volkanovski believes Islam Makhachev is a better grappler than Charles Oliveira and would defeat him in a bjj match.

    Is that surprising? Charles has been outgrappled multiple times before. Who has ever outgrappled Islam?

    I learned not to discredit anything Volk says.

    Charles is like the opposite of “position over submission” that everyone’s told. Gets him into bad spots

    Why is this even a debate? It's like this we saw this exact matchup a year ago and got a very clear answer there. Even if you love Oliveira, he was outmatched.

    Even coming from Brazil, I kinda gotta agree with Volk here, I'm not super confident on Oliveira's ability to beat Islam on the ground.

    I absolutely agree. Charles is a Jiujitsu savant, he has more technique and more variety of technique than anyone else in the roster but he simply lacks that stamina for control. I think Islam folds him even in Jiujitsu.

    Can we get Volk on commentary/analysis when he retires? He’ll shit all over DC and Bisping and give us hot roast lamb tips as well.
