    He got gifted randomly 500k USD Rolex watch few days ago when he visited the Dubai mall by a fan who put it on his arm and probably has few of these watches already. I think he has recieved alot of gifts in cash in the last 2 years. I don't think he is in it for the money at this point.
  
    He went from living in the gym to now starting to turn down sports cars and Rolex gifts because he has to many of them already.. Now the only thing remaining is smashing everybody dream to be realized it is not about the money anymore..

    Without brand sponsorships, this would probably be enough to pay his production team and maybe eat outside once

    Not likely. unless the videos have paid partnerships, these views aren’t producing much revenue.

    It’s not 2014 anymore. YouTubers (except for the top 1 - 5%) don’t make shit anymore.

    You don't get that much from YouTube themselves, but you get a shit tonne from sponsors for ad reads and social media posts.

    Don’t let the view count mislead you the one where he met king Zlatan had so many views it passed every number known to man so they had to restart the counter. TWICE
