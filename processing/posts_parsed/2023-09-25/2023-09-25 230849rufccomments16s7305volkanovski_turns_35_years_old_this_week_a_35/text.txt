Volkanovski turns 35 years old this week. A 35 year old fighter has never won a title fight in divisions LW and below. Will Volk break the streak?
If you count welterweight, the only fighter to win is Tyrone Woodley, who won twice.

    I think if anyone can beat the statistic, itâ€™s Volk.

    idgaf either way is cool (ilia FW champ or volk beating the odds)
  

    edit: if there's anybody to do it, it's volk. he could drop off a cliff in speed, but it's legit too hard to tell imo)

    with all these upsets so far this year alone, i feel volk won't escape his fate.
