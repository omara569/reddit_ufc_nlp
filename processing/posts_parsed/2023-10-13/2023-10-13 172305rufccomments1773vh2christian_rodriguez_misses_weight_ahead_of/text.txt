he missed by a lot too. 4 lbs? like what weight does he walk around at?

He probably decided itâ€™s better to miss weight and lose some money. A win over Cameron puts him in a spot where his next fight should get him a bigger payday and will redeem lost money on this bout.

that's risky though. Cameron could've declined the fight
