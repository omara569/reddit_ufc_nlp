Khamzat's fight could break his potential MW run. If he doesn't DOMINATE a fellow WW moving up, I don't think he can beat the MW top 5. They are on a completely different level than the rest of the division, and MUCH larger than any WW.

    Welterweights are better skillwise than Middleweight I think,
  
    Like DDP, Strickland, Whittaker and Vettori are former welterweights and are dominating the division

    Usman is also a world champion multiple time title defender.
  
    None of these other guys can say the same

    In WW with lots of mileage and takes a fight on really short notice, you have to mention this as well. Would still be a good win for Khamzat tho.

    I made Gordon Ryan tap in a sparring session once. We were flow rolling and he wasn't paying attention cause Danaher asked him something from the edge of the mat. My adcc belt is in the mail I guess cause a tap in sparring well that's basically like a tap in the cage! ...right?

    Everyone taps at sparring, unless you have a big ego and want injuries.

    Lol the size narrative thought it died. Anyone who thinks they will have size on Chimaev in the MW are size blind

    Having a year to bulk up is nice but you're crazy if you think someone like DDP or Cannonier aren't going to be bigger than a fresh MW Khamzat. But we'll see what be looks like next Saturday I guess
