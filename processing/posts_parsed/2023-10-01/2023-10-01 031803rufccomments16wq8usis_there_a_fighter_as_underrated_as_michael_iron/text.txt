is there a fighter as underrated as Michael "Iron" Chandler? beat Benson Henderson twice, Dan Hooker, Eddie Alvarez twice, finished Tony Ferguson & KO'd Patricky Freire. still giving the best in the world a run for their money even tho he's past his prime, Mike is a legend, wish he got more respect.

    Who disrespects mike? Every time he steps into the cage everyone knows it’s going to be a banger.

    He's 1-1 with Eddie.

    I can't stand the fact that he is always winning... until he loses.

    He would get more respect if he stopped fighting dumb. The guy is legit like you say, but he seems to throw all strategy out the window come fight night and just swang and bangs.
  
    The guy looked bad round 1 against the ghost of Tony Ferguson, that's all that needs to be said.

    A lot of people lost respect after the dustin fight as well. He’s always entertaining but he fights dirty and the back of the head shots were clear as day

    Chandler is really bizarre - I think he actually does have the technique, athleticism, and power to become champ - but his Dog IQ fightstyle always gets him in trouble.
  
    His wild man approach is both his saving grace and his downfall cause he’ll land an insane headkick like Ferg or get clipped. 95% of his finishes come within 1.5 rounds from start of fight. So Round 1 Michael Chandler could theoretically defeat any fighter, but after that it’s basically game over.

    Legit one of the funnest fighters to ever grace the sport. Just wish he'd have joined the UFC earlier than he did

    I've definitely grown to like Chandler. The man throws his wrestling out the window and displays explosive dynamic agressive striking. I just wished he fought smarter and more strategic and mixed up his weapons. His Bellator highlights are amazing. His striking seemed more crisp and accurate. If he came to the ufc in his prime, no doubt he'd be a champion. He would've fought McGregor that night instead of Alvarez.
