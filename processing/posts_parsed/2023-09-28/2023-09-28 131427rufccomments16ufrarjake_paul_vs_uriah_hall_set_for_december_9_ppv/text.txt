Glad Uriah gets paid but this shit isnâ€™t gonna get any buys.

Nice to see Hall getting paid.

Zero interest in this fight, though.

Yeah, I have no idea on how fights like this sell, but good for them.

This is a Uriah Hall fight, so I'm guessing there is a 35% chance Hall loses a decision because he doesn't throw, 35% chance he turtles up and gets KO'd, and a 30% chance he will throw something that turns Jake Paul into a coma patient.

Jake Paul age: 26

Average age of all of Jake Pauls boxing matches: 37

(Yes, this counts anesongib and tommy fury, the average is still that high)
