    I mean you could take bryce to space and show him the earth is round and he'd still make up some shit how it's flat. Flat earthers are not rational intelligent people

    The thing is these people are fundamentally rtarded like they don’t listen to evidence (usually). Bryce thinks gravity is fake!! His brain is made of piss

    It’s cognitive dissonance where the brain convinces itself of something being true because it contributes to a reality that feels safe. A lot people need to feel smarter than those around them in order to not be in a constant state of survival. It’s science from like 6th grade, but like you said there is no point in trying to reason with people like this.
