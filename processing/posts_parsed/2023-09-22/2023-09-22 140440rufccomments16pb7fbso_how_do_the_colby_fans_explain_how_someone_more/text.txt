So how do the colby fans explain how someone more controversial than him was able to win over the majority of the fan base? What excuse do you guys have now for nobody but yall liking colby? Maybe time to realize his shtick is just dumb?
Just find it hilarious that somebody was able to disprove that people didn't like colby because "everybody's woke"

    Cause Seans personality is appealing to many while Colby tries to be inflammatory to get attention. Sean has no interest in making people mad

    Colby tries to be someone like Sean but isn't,  its that simple.
  
    He's straight up a WWE character which is cringing as hell, plus boring fighting style.

    Sean is genuine. Colby is just playing heel to get attention.

    Point of Colby's schtick is to make people mad at him. Much like what OP is doing

    Colby isnt even very controversial, his persona is just cringy and entirely made up for attention. They both have some conservative opinions but thats about the only thing they have in common.

    Because sean is authentically a piece of shit. And colby is a poser. People respect authenticity.

    Exactly this.  Plus sean has some moments of redemption and even talks about how his surroundings and friends hes made have changed his viewpoints.  I’d say Sean is an Anti Hero while Colby is like a side character villain.  Hes like the opening scene “bad guy” in a marvel movie then the real villain comes out and we all completely forget about him
