    The brave redditors from this sub would rather die than associate themselves with this dictator

    I understand the argument that Khazmat must be friendly to protect himself and family from  Kadyrov.
  
    However, Khazmat also renounced his Swedish citizenship recently.  I'd think maintaining Swedish citizenship and helping your family emigrate would a better option if you didn't actually support  Kadyrov.

    He doesn't do it for family. Only delusional Khamzat fans think this

    He is deemed an "associate", right now he is a promoter of Sports and Health within Chechnya. At best he is really just his lackey, someone to entertain him and his family and give them clout.

    someone to entertain him
  

    Regarding this, there is a video of them "sparring" and he's ""kicking"" Khamzat's ass

    If im being honest, purely because Cumshit is Chechens biggest and only "star" in the world im sure gucci wearing Kadyrov wants the clout and treats him special because of it. Khamzat might not even actually like him but he doesnt really have a choice lol unless he wants to be assassinated or have family members tortured

    He has to support him.  If he doesnt then his family is in danger.  Just ask Fedor when he spoke out against Kadyrov's childrens MMA league
