    I’m glad you reminded me, because I was going to just go start some fights at a bar.
  
    Not saying I’m gonna fight, I was gonna start some and then act like I was DC commentating on them

    After Canelo's performance tonight I wanna hear what Teddy Atlas has to say after how much he shit on Canelo in the build up.

    Atlas kept prefacing every Tweet about the fight with “Canelo is so much bigger & stronger” despite Jermell Charlo being 4 inches taller and having a much bigger body frame despite technically coming up two weight classes.
