Dana White says Conor McGregor is not officially in the USADA testing pool. He submitted the paperwork and should be in next week sometime.

    Don't care about Conor anymore, but really happy for Chandler. He deserves this fight after the shit he went through to get it

    I’m one of the few people who does believe the Chandler fight will happen. Conor is a lot of things but I don’t think he’s the type to hype something this much only to pull out

    Nothing has been booked so there’s nothing to pull out of. He has just delayed as long as he possibly can. I mean it’s been what 6 months since they filmed ultimate fighter and he’s just getting in now? Really makes you think about how hard he must be juicing.

    90% of this sub are like „yeah I don’t care about that juicehead anymore“ but all of them will be watching.

    All of Conor’s social media now just consists of him advertising his alcohol. There’s nothing interesting about him anymore.
