This reminds me of that interview Anthony Smith did after losing to Jon Jones 😂😂😂😂😂😂 "He's Not That Good"

    “Guys he’s not a knockout artist. He just baited me into a blitz, gauged the distance perfectly, and landed on my jaw with pinpoint accuracy which faceplanted me. Not a knockout artist tho.”

    He didn’t knock him out, Sterling was just using the “your fist to my face” fighting style.

    Aljo has been using the ‘I ran into the shot’ excuse since the Marlon fight.
  
    The Marlon and Sean KO both came from him getting countered when closing distance. That’s the whole point of counter striking
  
    Aljo discredits Sean a lot for someone who won the belt by DQ

    Oh aljo. We all all saw this performance you can’t say Sean isn’t a knockout artist

    “ he’s not knocking chito out  unless he sets a trap that chito falls into and catches him with an accurate punch on the chin”

    “His counter punches won’t work unless he plans on countering with punches”
  
    Big brain activity here

    “Sean isn’t a knockout artist. he’s only knocked out, what, 12 dudes? In 19 fights? That’s less than a knockout per fight.”

    Really? They're going to stare at each other for five rounds and throw about 5 leg kicks. It's going to be a glorified sparring session.
