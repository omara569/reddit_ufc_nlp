For how good he is he should be a one of the most recognized legends to ever do it but most people don’t even know who he is. Why?Perhaps the most slept on, underrated fighter to ever do it

    his record is insane when you consider how long he’s been in the sport

    Beast of a fighter. He finished about 40 of his wins and majority in the first round. Won titles in every organization he fought, except the UFC. Fought as a natural MW at LHW and HW too. Speaking about BMFs.

    His resume is just insane. Especially compared with boxing where fighters like Crowford or Tyson Fury claim that they are HOF and ATG having maybe 3-4 decent guys on their lists.

    Gegard will forever be one of the biggest “what ifs?” In MMA history. Staying in the UFC could’ve gotten him a UFC title and far more fame than he has now.
  
    Former Bellator MW, Strikeforce LHW, DREAM MW/LHW and Cage Warriors MW champ, with 10 total title fight wins. Current 49-9-2 record with 40 of his wins coming via stoppage. He’s only been finished 3 times in his 60 fight career. He went on a 15 fight win streak across multiple promotions, including Pride, M-1, DREAM and Strikeforce.
  
    His resume is insane, including names like Douglas Lima, Rory MacDonald, Lyoto Machida, Dan Henderson, Chris Weidman, Uriah Hall, Vitor Belfort, Thiago Santos, Sokodjou, Mark Hunt, Hector Lombard  and Jacare Souza.
  
    He absolutely could’ve been a UFC champ if he stuck around.

    Yeah, he almost got his shot a couple times in the UFC but lost a couple big fights against Jacare and Uriah. It was a setback, but people could see he had huge potential. Then he actually put together an awesome run and avenged his loss to Uriah and beat former champs Vitor and Weidman....then it all stalled out. The UFC kept giving Yoel chances at the belt and Gegard got tired of it and left.
  
    It might have really been interesting to see him against guys like Whittaker, Yoel and even Izzy.

    He is too humble and unfortunately left UFC when he could have easily beat Michael Bisping with one hand behind in his back.
  
    He never cared about fame or belt. He only fought for money and he mentions that in every interview.

    It’s tragic to read some of these comments and people have no clue who he is. His name is Gegard Mousasi and he is an absolute legend of the sport.
