    So refreshing to have someone like volk be active and move up to challenge himself. Same respect to izzy when he tried and went up also.

    Volk always goes to one knee when he gets knocked down, which counts as a knockdown in boxing but is never counted in MMA. He did the same thing against Holloway and it wasnâ€™t counted. No hate on Volk, just an observation.

    Such a close fight but I think it was fair to give it 48-47 Makhachev

    Yeah. It was competitive but I don't see any other result than Islam win.

    That takedown in Round 5 is mastery

    This also highlights how strong fcking Volkanovski is and his gas tank is insane.
