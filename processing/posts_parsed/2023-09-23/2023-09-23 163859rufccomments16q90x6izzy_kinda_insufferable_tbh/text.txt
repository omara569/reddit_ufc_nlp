Izzy kinda insufferable tbh

    He has always said that tbf. It's why he doesn't duck anyone and welcomes all new comers. Fighters who are obsessed with keeping the belt tend to not be active as they're too afraid to take a risk and would rather sit out and soak in the limelight of a champion. Izzy didnt have to fight Strickland. He begged Dana for that fight when he could have sat out and waited for du plessis as a fresh and rested fighter. You have to give him credit for his eagerness to continually step into that octagon and put it all on the line time and time again. If he was too attached to his belt he wouldn't be anywhere near as active as he is.

    You know what, as an Izzy hater, I will give him that; he was active as champ, respect. Really wish he’d stop talking tho

    He’s insufferable but nothing wrong with this quote. He’s absolutely right.

    He really called his belt a tiara. Izzy really is a femboy

    He's goofy for sure, but what do you expect him to say? Do you expect him to admit that losing the belt gutted a huge part of his identity and it hurts going through life without calling himself the champ, especially since he lost it to a literal caveman with a slick shell and 1-2? Sounds like he's saying that partly to remind himself not to lose focus on the next fight.

    Compare this to the way Dricus is talking about getting the belt and their recent trajectories are making more sense
