This rematch deserves more of a build up and both guys having full camps to prepare for each other

    I agree. Especially considering if Volk takes another L then that's probably it. Why waste it on short notice? Volks crazy af ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤¦

    He's probably aware he wouldn't be getting a crack at the title any time soon as Islam still has a shitload of good fights with guys in his division. Plus the fact that fighting for champ-champ should be something rare, and not given to somebody once every year, no matter how good he is.

    Imagine Volk winning, though... Their rubber match next year would have plenty of drama to it

    Volk wins, setting up the trilogy next summer.
