unpopular opinion but the Conor in this fight finishes Volk inside 3 rounds (if he moved up)

    I don't know why people overrate the Eddie Alvarez fight. Conor put on a great performance but Volkanovski brings a much different style to the table than Eddie does. Eddie fought like a bar room brawler that night and played right into Conor's strengths. Volk would be too smart to do that.

    tbh i like Eddie, but he really looked, "terrified" in that octagon that night, it reminds me of Beneil vs Oliveira (with Alvarez being Dariush)
  
    just completely caught off guard by the crowd roaring, stakes of the fight etc, looked very hesitant every action too.
  
    also, another reason why i think people overrate this performance, is that a big factor is Eddie getting gradually more and more concussed after every knockdown. so conor dominated an eddie getting gradually more and more concussed. its not like he beat eddie 1000 different times

    Lol this was a stylistic nightmare for EDDDDDIEEE!!! Volk would be fine vs Conor and I'm not even a Volk stan just realistic.  Like Conor ain't hanging past ten minutes with Volk unless he gets on EPO too

    The only thing conor has left to finish, is his fucking downfall.
  
    He will never challenge a top 5 fighter again, and if we are being honest, I sincerely doubt that conor will ever be a challenge to anyone in the top 10 again.

    eh volk is a better striker and better boxer. i think it'll look like yair but with more striking and considering volk's cardio he might turn mcgregor into minced meat but volk is a bit chinny so maybe
