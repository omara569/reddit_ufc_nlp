    That's not a prediction that's a prayer, picking 3 big underdogs at the top of main card ðŸ˜‚

    Bro! I would want nothing more! However, if there's anything I've learned is to go against my desires. So, although I agree with you on the bottom two, I believe you have the top four wrong and that's how this card is going to go.
  
    Can the bot remember this?

    Iâ€™ll be going Makhachev, Costa, Imavov, Ankalaev, Nurmagomedov, Mokaev. Probably deposit $10, start at $5 on Mokaev with half my bet funds, then take half the winnings of that and roll ML until Costa and dump everything profit into him and still have the remaining initial $5 ($10 deposit total) to throw on main event if I lose along the way. Can usually turn $10 to $40-100 every event I bet on doing it like this
