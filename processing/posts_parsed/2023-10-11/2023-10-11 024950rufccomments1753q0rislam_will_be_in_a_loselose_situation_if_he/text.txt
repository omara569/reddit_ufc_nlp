Islam will be in a lose-lose situation if he fights Volk in 294

    I'm more mad that they make Islam sit around for 8 months for this big special card for the Middle East for him to get shafted.
  
    If he wins all the haters will say it doesn't count still

    pretty much. haters completely disregarded his win in the first fight, they will be the same if he wins here.

    man that's some bs, Islam's title defenses are all gonna be rematches? lol it's like we all agreed he'd beat Dustin, Justin and Chandler so UFC is not even entertaining those fights... He may beat them but those fights still need to happen especially Justin.

    Yeah ngl everyone’s talking about Volk and calling him a BMF (which he is tbh) but no love for Islam at all. It’s hard to completely train for one style of opponent and then have to change it up. Plus no matter what islam does he’ll get ZERO credit if he wins. Hell even if he were to starch Volk round 1 people will not give him props. Ima be honest im rooting for Islam even more now

    I feel bad for Islam in this. He got no credit for the first fight, and now this one is most definitely a lose lose situation for him.
  
    He could potentially beat Volk twice, and people will still rank and hold Volk higher than him.

    Yup. 100%. Guarantee they give Volk a 3rd chance next year too, and use this as the reason.

    Yes. This is correct. Training camp is CRUCIAL. Short notice matters a lot.

    I love Volk but I don’t think this was a good idea to fight Islam on short notice… I’ve watched the first fight a million times and I don’t know what it was but Islam didn’t seem 100% maybe a bad weight cut he looked dehydrated… I think Volk may be underestimating Islam because of the first fight which could be a big mistake

    The weigh in for that fight was only 24 hours before. Normally the weigh in is 36 hours before the fight. Also according to islams camp usada drew blood from him after the weigh in too.
  
    this is just me spitballing, but fighting in a foreign country like australia it might be hard for islam to find a decent gym, find food, find a comfortable place to stay etc. You never really know what is happening behind the scenes.
