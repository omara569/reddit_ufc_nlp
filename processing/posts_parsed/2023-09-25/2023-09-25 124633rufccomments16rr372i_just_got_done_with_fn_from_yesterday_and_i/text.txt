I just got done with FN from yesterday, and I couldn't believe these 2 baby's Cody took the easy DQ win because he was getting smashed, then Jake was milking the shit out of the eye poke while not blinking red around the eye's. I hate these type fighters who are losing find way 2 cheat or milking it

    This is coming from a guy who never took a bad eye poke. It's red because you rub it normally. Also, people have been paralyzed or worse from shots to the back of the head. Just because guys way tougher than you want to make sure they are fully good to go before getting punched in the face again doesn't make them Harlequin's but just makes them smart.

    Cody absolutely milked that strike behind the head, no doubt in my mind.
  
    Saying that Jake was milking that eye poke though is just you being ridiculous. Usman near got his whole damn finger in Collier’s eye there, and you could see the doctor saying he didn’t want the fight to keep going. A bad enough eye poke will absolutely have you freaking out on the ground like Collier was - just look at Leon Vs Belal.

    Jake was injured badly, took the time to continue and recovered but the bout shifted towards Usman after that in my humble opinion. Never tried to stop the bout and always wanted to continue even with the compromised vision.
  
    Cody took the easy way out, knowing that he was exhausted due to the pace set and took some damage as well. It is what it is, basically took advantage of the situation.

    Crazy how Jake is was only a +115 dog, bet the house on Usman.
  
    Scared me how little he wrestled though

    He also got smoked first round. I was a little nervous during that but he recovered fairly well and kept it going
