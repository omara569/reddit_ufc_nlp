    Arnold is an outstanding talent.
  
    Canâ€™t wait to see how far he can go.

    Seems a great guy as well. His YouTube videos are always fun to watch, replies to every comment which is quite cool. Just seems like a regular bloke you'd meet down the pub. His meal deal reviews were legendary for us UK'ers lol.

    Why these two look like twins?
  
    Allen should be fighting Ortega or Yair, get them out the top 5.

    Ortega just doesn't want to fight bapa. Rank squatting and not fighting is the key to staying top 5 in the UFC.

    I think Allen takes it.  Movsar is a but overrated

    Movsar is legit top 5 material, only a matter of time before he shows up in the top 5.

    I donâ€™t like how Iâ€™d havenâ€™t heard of Movsar and people all over his dick
