Two guys fighting for a titleshot in a division they aren't ranked. Has this happened before?

    IIRC the winner of conor vs diaz 2 was promised a LW title shot

    UFC has it’s stupid moments but this is an example of the times their crazy don’t care methods are totally in line with what fans want.
  
    An amazing match up, where honestly rankings don’t mean anything - both guys are absolute studs - and a ton on the line for the winner.
  
    All put together in a day or two. Try and get two high profile fighters to agree to fighting each other any other time. Love it.

    As a fan. I rather watch Sean vs Usman/Chimaev over Cannonier/DDP.

    The court of public opinion also states that Usman or Chimaev beating the other at 185 grants a title shot. It states that they both are tough SOBs and that otherwise with Izzy taking a break and Dana mad at Diamond Dallas Page, Whitaker and Cannonier are accounted for and Vettori just eh, it makes perfect sense as a shakeup. Dana is all about business, hype, and I mean it's not totally out of left field to think one of these guys could beat Strickland and/or be a 185 champ.

    Has Usman stated he wants to fight for the 185 belt? Has Khamzat? Seems like the every other week Khamzat makes a comment about being a welterweight

    Tbh, based purely on the odds and the way the fight is probably going to playout, you should either bet the house on Usman or you shouldn’t and bet the house on Chimaev

    My feeling is that one of them will win.
