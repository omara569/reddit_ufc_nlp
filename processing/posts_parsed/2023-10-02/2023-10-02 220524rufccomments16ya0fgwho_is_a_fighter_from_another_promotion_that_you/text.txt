Who is a fighter from another promotion that you think would do excellent in the UFC?
I'll start with Bellator's welterweight champion and #3 P4P fighter in the company, 27-0 Ukranian destroyer Yaroslav Amosov üá∫üá¶

    Sadibou Sy is pretty old but I think he could have had a lot of fun fights. Johnny Eblen would honestly be a title contender Anatoly Malykhin at 205 would be a menace, even at HW he might contend.

    Vadim Nemkov and Usman Nurmagomedov. Also, I swear Demetrious Johnson could come back right now and get his belt back. The flyweight have evolved a lot, but not to his level.
