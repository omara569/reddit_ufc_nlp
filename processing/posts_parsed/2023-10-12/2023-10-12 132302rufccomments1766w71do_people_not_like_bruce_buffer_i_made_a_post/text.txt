Do people not like Bruce Buffer? I made a post yesterday and people were saying he’s cringe now and they don’t like his intros. Am I crazy?? How can you not love Bruce Buffer??

    It doesn't matter who they are or what they do, someone on the Internet is going to talk shit about them

    Welcome to Reddit, where everyone hates everything and my feet are sore.

    Eh he’s fine. I’ve never understood people having strong opinions about him one way or another. He’s just been doing the job for a long time so he’s a mainstay. The only thing that’s cringe about him is that he got fake abs implanted.

    I’m surprised people actually prefer Joe Martinez. Bruce is the best

    People disagreeing with each other on the internet? How could we let such a thing happen.

    I think he’s mostly universally liked but people don’t like when he gets preachy towards fighters or sometimes how he seems to overdo it with intros.
  
    I personally think he brings a uniqueness to the sport that we won’t ever get again and he’ll be very missed.
