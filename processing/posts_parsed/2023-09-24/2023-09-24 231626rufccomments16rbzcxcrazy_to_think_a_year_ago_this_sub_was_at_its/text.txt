Crazy to think A year ago this sub was at its most toxic, A everlasting war between two Fandoms collided for months over a fight, Tons of Racism, Bigotry, and a whole lotta insults; Lets all reflect upon this time.

    You say that as if racism, bigotry, and insults aren’t still a core part of every comment thread.

    It was mostly “Charles fans” who were posting all the toxic stuff. People were posting crazy fake stories about Islam.
  
    For example I remember someone posted that some Russian pornstar was actually Islams sister and his family disowned her. The post stood for 4 hours.

    Alright buddy let’s not get crazy. I was absolutely a part of the flame war last year, but I rarely saw anyone actually hauling racial slurs or religious intolerance. A lot of the flaming really boiled down to “Charles hasn’t fought a real wrestler,” and “Islam doesn’t deserve a shot yet.” Really feels like you’re trying to stir up anger here.
