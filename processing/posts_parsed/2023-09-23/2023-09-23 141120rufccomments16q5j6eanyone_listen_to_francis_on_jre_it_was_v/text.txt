Anyone listen to Francis on JRE? It was v enlightening on UFC business practices. Also he seems like a real genuine nice guy.

    It’s weird such a terrifying human has such a gentle and soothing voice. He could legitimately be a voice actor in a Disney movie.

    I wonder how much it costs for him to read bed time stories to me.

    nah. Rogan and Dana are close friends and Dana knows that bad publicity is still good publicity. It’d be different if Rogan was shitting on him but Joe didnt do that. Plus Dana knows that Rogan is literally bringing in organic viewers for FREE to the UFC.

    Yea I became a huge Francis fan after this. He’s genuinely got a really good head on his shoulders if a few hour interview can give any insight to that sort of thing I guess. Regardless it was really cool to listen to and there are a handful of fighters that have been on and been super cool to listen to

    UFC has absolutely trash business practices. Good for Ngannou for getting out of his contract/getting the deal he wanted.

    Good guy. Even during his negotiations, he wanted to get paid and tried keeping all other fighters interest at heart. Like come on, whats so much to let fighters have an approved sponsor or two on their shorts?

    Only Dana White can try to make Francis seem/look like a bad guy. Dana sucks!
