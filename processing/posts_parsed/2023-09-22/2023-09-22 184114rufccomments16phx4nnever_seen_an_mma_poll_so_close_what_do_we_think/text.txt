Never seen an mma poll so close. What do we think?
I’m taking Leon by headshot in the 1st 🙏

    Anyone out there who doubts either guy is foolish. Both men have many paths to victory. No Colby is not going to go in there and rag doll Leon, but he might exhaust Leon and get the W. No Leon is not going to go in there and easily stuff every TD Colby has and piece him up with ease, but he might have the defense and cardio to keep it in his realm and win. We don’t know. Can’t wait to find out, this is exactly why Colby was the right choice.

    If you’re gambling on this fight, Colby by decision is gonna be the line to play

    It’d be one thing if Colby has been active but having not seen him fight in 18 months and with how Leon dominated Usman in the rematch, have to say Leon is the clear favorite. Hope it’s a competitive and entertaining fight though.
