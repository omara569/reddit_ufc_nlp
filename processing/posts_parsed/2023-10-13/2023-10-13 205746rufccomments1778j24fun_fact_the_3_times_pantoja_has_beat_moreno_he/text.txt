Fun fact: The 3 times Pantoja has beat Moreno he took something from him. First, he kicked him off TUF. Second, he got him cut from the UFC. Third, he took his belt.

    What's crazy is that at least in brazilian interviews he doesnt even care for moreno. He says things like "yeah, moreno was a tough fight. Next topic"
