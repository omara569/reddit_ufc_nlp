Honestly no shade, really just think it’s crazy how fast shit changes in this sportHilarious to see where these 2 have gone since their beef. Topuria is likely fighting the p4p #1 Volkanovski while Paddy fights the ghost of the ghost of Tony Ferguson

    Paddy is a smart lad for not getting put on a snuff tape against Topuria

    Paddy knows what he's doing. He signed a major deal with barstool. In order to be worth it to barstool he needs to be relevant and winning, he's in no rush for hunting in the shark tank.

    honestly i think paddy would take some dangerous fights if offered but the ufc isn’t dumb enough to do that. he doesn’t strike me as a coward that’s for sure

    I still can’t believe that clip from embedded where he literally sprays himself 10-15 times with cologne. It’s honestly one of the most insane things I’ve ever seen.

    With a win over #75 ranked lightweight fighter Tony Ferguson, Paddy will crack the top ten 😎

    i don’t really care about paddy i just think it’s incredible how fast things in this sport change. if you can’t understand that perspective without thinking it’s hate or a “circlejerk” then that’s on you
  
    also he is very much not “getting in the rankings” until he you know.. faces someone ranked
