    Yes. Would be epic
  
    And then see Leon go for Champ-Champ status?

    If Usman tags Khamzat like Burns did, I would reckon that Usman would KO him.

    I'm as ready for a KO in the UFC as I am kicking my toe, either way I'll yell "oh shit" and then stand there in contemplative silence

    I donâ€™t think he will, BUT if he did Iâ€™m losing my shit. I think his knees are done though and I donâ€™t know if we see him back to Prime Usman.
