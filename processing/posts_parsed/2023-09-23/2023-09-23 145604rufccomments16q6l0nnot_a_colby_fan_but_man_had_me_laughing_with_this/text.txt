    Colby is funny at times but his fans are just crazy.
  
    He could stick his tongue out and they‚Äôd be like ‚Äúlove or hate Colby, he‚Äôs hilarious man‚Äù

    Any trash talk Colby throws at Leon just isn't gonna work.
  
    Leon was the first person to take Usman down, the first person to mount him, first to take his back and the first to KO him. Colby got his knee to touch the ground for 0.01secs. Leon also earned his title shot by going on a 14 fight unbeaten streak, with Usman being the guy who beat him the fight before the streak started.
  
    In the first fight Colby got his jaw broke by a pre-Whitman Usman who was a poor striker. In the first title fight Leon KO'd Usman with arguably the greatest roundhouse head kick KO of all time and one of the best KOs in title fight history, let alone there only being seconds left in the fight and Usman never having been KO'd.
  
    Then in the rematch Leon was even better and won despite getting a point deducted. Colby in the rematch won 1 round and lost again.
  
    I'm not saying this means Leon is guaranteed to beat Colby, cos I know styles make fights and MMA math doesn't work. But anything Colby trashes Leon about are completely mute points cos he can't even trash him for sitting out for long periods (which wasn't Leon's fault anyway).

    It was 10 fights if you include the NC against Belal. Definitely not 14
