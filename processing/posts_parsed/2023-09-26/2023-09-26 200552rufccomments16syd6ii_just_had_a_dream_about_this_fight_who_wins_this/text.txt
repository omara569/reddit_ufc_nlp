I just had a dream about this fight. who wins this?
Ciryl Gane Vs Alex Pereira        In my dream Alex was winning and managed to drop ciryl Gane once then stunned him later on but he was robbed. Ciryl did manage to knockdown Alex and take him down and get control time with his body mass

    ciryl would genuinely fuck him up imo. he keeps distance very well and is hard to hit. mf made it five rounds with francis, i can't help but feel that he'd run circles around alex.

    Nah he wouldn’t use pure skill to beat Alex I think he definitely is going to need to use his weight and size advantage in order to win. He should also throw power punch’s in hope of landing
  
    My dream thinks otherwise If that even matters

    If they both were the same size, height etc pereira is the more technically skilled fighter but since ciryl is huge he could probably take alex down. I know his wrestling is shit but so is Alex's and ciryl has a big weight advantage

    Yeah I agree one straight from  ciryl could be enough for a finishing sequence.
  
    But my dream says other wise

    The fight was a co main event for the interim Heavyweight championship whilst Alex was light heavyweight champ

    Ciryl could win if he uses wrestling since he has a huge weight advantage with good Ju jitsu.
  
    I honestly think Alex has overrated power even for light heavyweight even tho my dream says otherwise

    I just don't like Gane as a fighter, he looks soft and like someone is forcing him to fight. So i pick Alex definitely.
