Iâ€™m guessing heâ€™s on the roids + heâ€™s a raging alcoholic and he lllloooooovvvvves the cocaine . That should be enough to not join usada

Idk if you saw but.. Conor was hanging out with Snoop the other day, and, let's just say Snoop was the one that had to pace himself.

I've been telling you mfs. They're saving Conor for UFC 300. They gotta make that a big one and it doesn't get much bigger than a McGregor card. Both him, Dana AND Chandler are in on it, they're just not talking about it, obviously.

Heâ€™d have to be in the testing pool in the next 3-ish weeks for him to be cleared for mid April

We all lose if it doesnâ€™t happen.  It would be a banger.

Part of me thinks that Conor has regretted accepting the fight and is pulling Chandler along until he gives up on the fight.

Dana thinks he's saving Conor for Ufc300 but he's an addict who won't fight in the UFC again.

Mark my words.
