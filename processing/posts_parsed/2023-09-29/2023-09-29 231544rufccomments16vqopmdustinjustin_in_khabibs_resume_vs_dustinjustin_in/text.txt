They are seen and given credit for as the best wins for both Khabib and Oliveira, so I don't really see your point.

Because a lot of people downplay them for Khabib. Like saying they're his best wins but aren't that good

I’m so removed from this that I don’t even know which picture to attribute to which fighter

Justin and Dustin are two of the best LWs ever. I’d place them both as top 10 in LW history. Beating them is a big feat. Khabib and Charles both defeated them and deserve praise for it.

I do think there is a difference in how they beat them. Khabib’s wins were more dominating and one sided. If Khabib faced them 10 times, I’d bet Khabib wins 9. If Charles faced them 10 times, I’d bet he beats them 6 times.

Not to mention Poirier was on a 5 fight winstreak and Gaethje was on a 4 fight winstreak when they faced Khabib.

But Oliveira fans want to conveniently forget about that Having a huge momentum winstreak wise is definitely a big factor
