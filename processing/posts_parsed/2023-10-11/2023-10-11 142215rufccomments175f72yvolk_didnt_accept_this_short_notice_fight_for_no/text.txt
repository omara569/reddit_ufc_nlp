Volk didn't accept this short notice fight for no reason. He's well calculated and ready to put the new adjustments against Islam. And his fight IQ is scary

    Win or lose, you gotta respect both Islam and Volk for taking the most difficult matchup on short notice.

    I'll say one thing about Volk, dude is a true fighter, although I must admit as others have pointed out, for Volk he literally has nothing to lose, he can lose the damn fight and he still has his title and probably doesn't lose shit on p4p rankings. Risk/reward is heavily in Volk's favor. Plus maybe it's not fair but folks will also say "it was Abu Dhabi" so Volk has more excuses

    He has a lot to lose. If it's a unanimous decision and Islam wins by a wide margin, people won't want to see them fight again anytime soon, which could mean no lw title opportunity for Volk again for a long time.

    Canâ€™t wait to see you clowns justify Volk being ahead in P4P after losing to Islam twice. Absolute joke

    Islam better come prepared and not underestimate him this time.

    I thought he tweeted or said something on Instagram about staying ready incase Charles pulls out. That was a month or so ago.

    The real reason why he took the fight on short notice.
