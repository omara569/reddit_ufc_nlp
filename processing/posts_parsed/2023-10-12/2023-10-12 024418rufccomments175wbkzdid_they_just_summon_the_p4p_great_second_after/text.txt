Did they just summon the P4P great, second after GSP, in a short notice fight? Did they forget his only recent loss was against Leon which will beat Khamzat aswell? Usman wins this and challenges Strickland for the rematch, Dana white golden ticket to the top

    Getting knocked out like he did fucks with your confidence and it showed in the last fight with Leon.
  
    He could be on a downward trajectory but we it won't be clear until after this fight.

    I think itâ€™s gonna be ugly, khamzat wrecks him.

    Prime for current khamzaht I think usman absolutely diddles him but thereâ€™s a lot of variables right now

    I believe prime Usman wouldâ€¦ but I saw a video where he was explaining that his knees have no cartilage left they are literally bone on boneâ€¦ The Nigerian Nightmare has nothing left to prove I would rather see him retire before the sport retires him

    I dont even like khamzat but hes 100% gonna win, he is at every disadvantage and hes old and worn out at this point in his career.
  
    Maybe I'm wrong but I doubt it, we will see in 10 days though

    Idk about putting those odds at 100%. Especially with what we saw happen to usman vs Edward's with the head kick, sean and izzy, etc

    Doesnâ€™t have to cut and has more experience in the trenches than Khamzat. Usman wins
