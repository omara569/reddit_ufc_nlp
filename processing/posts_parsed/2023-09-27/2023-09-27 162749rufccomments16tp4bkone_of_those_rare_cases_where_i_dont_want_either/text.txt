I'm rooting for Yan more though.One of those rare cases where I don't want either guy to lose.

This is a good fight for the two of them. Both are on the tipping points of their careers. This is the classic get one of them a win type fight. Can Yan return to form and be a top contender again or is he done? Can Song finally put it all together or will he remain a middle of the pack contender? My vote is on Yan returning to form as he hasn't taken too much damage. For how young Song is, he's been in some wars for his age and that will likely effect the outcome of him ever being a contender.

Rooting for song tbh never really liked petr, but if petr wants to "revive" his career he has to win this one I feel like this dude is 2 losses away from being cut

Lmfao Yan cut? Yan's been losing to top tier opponents are you crazy? Close match with Aljo the 2nd time, arguably beat O Malley, and the got wrecked by Merab who'd do the same thing to O Malley and a lot of guys on that division. Retire for those loses is mental. Now Tony on the other hand
