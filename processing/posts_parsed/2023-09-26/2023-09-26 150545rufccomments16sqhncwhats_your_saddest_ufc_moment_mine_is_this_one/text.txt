    TKZ’s entire career honestly.
  
    Last chance to avoid military service is a title fight win over aldo. TKZ blows out his shoulder in the 4th, loses the fight. Tries to get one more bout in and has to pull out due to injury, misses 4 years of his prime.
  
    Comes back in stunning fashion with a 1st round KO of Bermudez, then loses in stunning fashion with a last-second KO loss to Yair Rodriguez, in a fight that he was winning, simply because he wanted to entertain the fans.
  
    Bounces back with two straight first round finishes, then drops a #1 contender fight to Ortega. Returns with a win over Ige and scores a short-notice replacement title fight with Volk.
  
    Gets battered by volk, resulting in a standing TKO. Breaks down into tears after the fight, admitting that he doesn’t believe he has what it takes to be a champion.
  
    Takes his final fight against Max Holloway in his home continent. In a bout he knows he can’t win, he swings for the fences and gets brutally KOed, calling it a career, he leaves the octagon to crying family members, his gloves are stolen on the way out.

    But the entire crowd on its feet singing Zombie to their hero as he left the cage made up for all of it. You don’t have to win them all to win the crowd. Zombies ups and downs were caused by his kill or be killed attitude…and the crowd loved him for it. There is not a better retirement speech and crowd response in the sport that I’ve ever seen.

    It’s sad that he even had to go to military service. I’m a Korean and Korea exempts K-pop stars from military service all the time but denied Korean Zombie his exemption, despite being the best fighter that Korea has ever had to offer. It’s cringe as FUCK

    The Ferguson/Gaethje fight.
  
    That or watching Diego Sanchez during the Fabian era.

    Nick Diaz in the GSP press conference, it’s the “you wanna make me the villain, I guess I’m the villain”.
  
    For me it just shows that Nick isn’t the gangster or tough guy, he never liked fighting and he’s had to force his way into any positive situation he’s ever had.

    Off the top of my head watching Frankie Edgar get obliterated in front of his little kids in his retirement fight.

    My saddest moment in the UFC is when Gerard Mussassi lost the title on Bellator.
