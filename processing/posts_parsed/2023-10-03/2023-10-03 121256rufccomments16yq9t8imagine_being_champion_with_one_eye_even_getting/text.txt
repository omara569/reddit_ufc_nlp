Imagine being champion with one eye. Even getting into the top 10 will be impressive enough

    The way he took the fight to the guy outside of the mall after not beating him in the mall shows he's not afraid to use all his tools to find success.
  
    Setting that trap as the random man walked out the door is champ level fight IQ.
  
    It's the shots you don't see coming that put you out. Future champ right here.

    He kinda reminds me of Petr Yan, they're both so inventive.
  
    I loved how he faked the tap at a BJJ tournament, then stood and kicked his downed opponent in a fit of rage at a grappling only setting. Always evolving the game, those two.
