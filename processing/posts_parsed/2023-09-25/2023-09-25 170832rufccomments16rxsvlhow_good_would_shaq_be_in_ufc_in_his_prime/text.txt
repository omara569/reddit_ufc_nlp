    Why do Americans think that Basketball/NFL players are the best athletes and therefore would be the best fighters?
  
    You realise that football (soccer to you) is the most popular sport world wide? and that every kid in almost every country other than the US (and maybe Canada) aspires to be a football player?...and yet somehow its not only giant dudes that make it?...being a basketball player or an NFL player does not equal being a superior athlete to all other sports.
  
    Being that tall is almost a disability if your sole purpose in life isn't to reach high-up things easily.
  
    Also, are we forgetting about Mark Hunt, Roy Nelson, Tai Tuivasa etc etc.? There are little fat dudes in the heavyweight division who destroy bigger, more conventionally athletic opponents on a regular basis.
  
    How are you guys so confident that these sport specific athletes would automatically be the best fighters? its makes no sense at all and we have even seen the results of NFL players who switch over. Isn't it funny how they don't just waltz their way to the title?

    If his athleticm translates and hes not injured in training over and over hed most likely be a champion. Hes one of the most athletic big men of all time and one of the naturally strongest people on earth. He did armwrestling against devon larrett and he said hes the strongest untrained person hes ever gone against and it didnt seem like the next person was close. This was shaq nowadays too and not in his prime.

    Depends on his mentality, if he still flops like he does now then he might get beat by CM Punk. If he had a better mentality he might’ve been a ranked LHW or HW with those genetics

    Could he make 265? He would have been competing in Pride , not in this pussy ass 265 limit org. Among real heavyweights, like Choi or Sapp. Even Schillt. Zuluzinho would have been a good first test for him.
