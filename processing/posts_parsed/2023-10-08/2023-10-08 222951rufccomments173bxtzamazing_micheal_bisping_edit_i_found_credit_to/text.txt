    Bisping was hard as nails. His reign as champ was shit because he was pushing 40 and his body was a complete wreck by that point. Missing eye, severe nerve damage/atrophy in his right arm, double knee replacement imminent, suffered multiple brutal KO's and all the wear and tear he had accumulated fighting in the UFC for over 10 years. The UFC 100 KO alone would have ended many careers especially when you consider the amount of shit he got online for it, I remember and all the photoshops, memes, videos etc the entire mma fanbase was clowning on him for getting brutally H-bombed, most fighters never would have come back from that kind of trauma. I honestly don't blame him for ducking Romero and taking the big money fights at the end to secure his family's future. Don't let revisionist history cover over the fact he was game as fuck throughout his career before winning the title at the end.

    Ngl he didn‚Äôt even duck Romero, bro failed a drug test the year he became champ.
  
    I would honestly pick a prime Luke rockhold fight Bisping to beat Romero. Yoel relies on the big shot way to much and doesn‚Äôt have good cardio. It‚Äôs honestly not a bad match up for Bisping as he has infinite cardio and a great chin.
  
    I would have like to have seen him fight Jacare ideally though, since Yoel was out due to the sauce at the time.

    Rockhold vs Bisping was and still is one of the biggest upset in UFC history for sure. At that point in their respective careers, Rockhold seemed almost unbeatable and Bisping was a journeyman at best.

    31 year old former strikeforce MW champ and current UFC champ with a win over the current challenger
  
    VS
  
    37 year old UFC Vet who has zero accomplishments and an L to the current Champ.
  
    Truly the upset of the ages

    That's a very satisfying title win, IMO. His body of work and resume was worthy

    Why didn't herb stop the fight? I've seen him stop it for much less, not trying to take anything away from bisping but it looked like he was 1 slap away from done
