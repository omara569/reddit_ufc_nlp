Khamzat fan but at -290 people are underrating Usman. Leon 3 was close, he won 19 straight fights and 24 mins of the 20th, has proven to have greater power and stamina, has legit wrestling, great coaches, and champ pedigree. Khamzat's still a bit unproven and hasn't gained a crazy amount of weight.
