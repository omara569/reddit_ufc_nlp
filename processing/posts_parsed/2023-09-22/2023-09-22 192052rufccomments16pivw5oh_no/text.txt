    Watching Shavkat's fight with Neal, it's not completely impossible that Wonderboy pulls it off. His takedown defense needs to be a lot better than it was against Belal. Can't deny it's ballsy to take this one. I wonder if they agreed to make him the backup for the main event if he would agree to fight Shavkat?

    I really wish the fight with Pereira happened.

    This is Dana's payback for Wonderboy declining the fight when Pereira was overweight
