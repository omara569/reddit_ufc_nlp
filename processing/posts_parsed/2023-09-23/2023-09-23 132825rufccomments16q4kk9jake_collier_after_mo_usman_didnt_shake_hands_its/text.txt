Jake Collier after Mo Usman didn't shake hands, "It's like that, huh? Just cause your brother can fight doesn't mean you can."

    That awkward moment after an intense face-off when they're told "Exit is that way" and they calmly walk towards the same direction.

    Why do I feel like Jake will actually beat usman? Jake looks more in shape than heâ€™s ever been since he was roiding in middleweight ðŸ¤£

    Usman got dropped twice and subbed by an old fat guy in pfl so itâ€™s not out of the question
