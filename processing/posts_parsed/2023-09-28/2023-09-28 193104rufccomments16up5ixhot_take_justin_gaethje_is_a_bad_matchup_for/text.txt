Why do you think that?

I think heâ€™s even easier for Islam than Khabib because of Islamâ€™s standup.

Islam has really good counter striking and mixed with the takedown threat, I think he can do serious damage to Justin like he did to Charles. He also has pretty good footwork so will have better success than Khabib at defending leg kicks.

Gaethje has improved a lot since the Khabib fight but I reckon heâ€™ll panic when Islam closes the distance and clinches him.

yeah have to agree with this, i don't see how Gaethje will win this, feel like this will just be a worse than Khabib v Gaethje mauling

Yeah college level takedown defense is not gonna be enough for someone Islams level. We also know hes got the dog in him so rd3 2:10.

If he was not a bad matchup for Khabib, he would not be a bad matchup for Islam.
