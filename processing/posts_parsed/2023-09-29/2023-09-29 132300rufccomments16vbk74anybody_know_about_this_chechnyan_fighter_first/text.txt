Anybody know about this chechnyan fighter? First name is hazmat?
Boris, is what they call him, Chimaev, which means wolf.        Khazmat is what they call him because, it's his first name.        Chechnya is where he's from because, that's where the hospital his mother had him was at        I COULD GO ON AND ON        Khazmat not-chimaev. First name is khazmat that's a story to me.
