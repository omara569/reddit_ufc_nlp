Does Israel make other men insecure about themselves by being flamboyant and care-free while still being more successful and stronger than them? Is this why Reddit has a hate boner for him?

Care-free? Bro literally lost because he couldn’t get out of his own head after middle school level trash talk.

Care free? Are you braintarded? He literally lost his belt in large part because Strickland got on his head. Immediately after losing he was trying to convince Sean that he doesn’t fuck dogs.

the dog touching? the cringey lines? the racism? the boring fights? the humping paulo costa and pretending to be kod alex pereira infront of pereira's son then begging strickland to not roast him in the post fight interview?

I’m a fan Israel but I think the reason why people dislike him is partly because of him being cringe, and also that he is a defensive counterstriker

No, I don't like him because he's not genuine.

He's a sore loser, and acts like a gracious winner. He preaches emotional toughness when he's actually pretty soft and sensitive.

Which you know, nothing wrong with being sensitive, he's just fake about it.
