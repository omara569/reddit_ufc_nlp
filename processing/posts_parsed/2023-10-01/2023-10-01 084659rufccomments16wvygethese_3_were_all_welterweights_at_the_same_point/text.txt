These 3 were all welterweights at the same point in time (2013)

    I also have to mention the fact that Dricus made his pro debut at 19 while Volk only started training at 22

    Minor correction, he didn't start actual MMA training at 22, it was really just strength and conditioning work he never wanted to do at the start disguised as it in hopes he would actually do his S&C work. His actual training was at 23 where Joe Lopez and Rushy both put him through gauntlet style sessions. Prior to that he only did hill sprints, chin-ups/pullups/pushups/Bodyweight squats as strength/conditioning and he still does them now even to the disapproval from his S&C coaches

    I didn’t know DDP was a welterweight that’s interesting. I also didn’t know that Strickland was too until a couple months ago

    That is interesting because I consider DDP to be a huge middleweight. He made Rob look small.

    Yeah he was a superhuman at welterweight too.
