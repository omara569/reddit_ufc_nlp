Were we robbed ?

    I blame Michel for that one, he was always a size bully.

    Absolutely agree. I really don’t understand what this borderline 205er is doing fighting at 170. Wonderboy was right not to fight him for missing weight.

    This would have been fun but it leads WB nowhere. Was anybody gonna put him in the title picture off this win? WB has been given a VERY real and genuine chance to make a final title run in his career.

    no Wonderboy will now fight Shavkat which is way more interesting

    Why way more interesting? Shavkat probably wrestles his ass off and beats up Wondy, but Michel more likely would just strike with him. And it would be a fun fight on the feet.

    It's Michel's fault. You don't have to rub two brain cells together to realize that this guy is not a welterweight when watching his fights.

    My favourite Michel moment was him slapping the shit out of Imadaev, showing him the open hand, giving it a kiss, and then molly whopping the mf because he slapped him at the face offs, he landed a bunch of really good ones too.

    Would've been a fun fight, but Wonderboy wants to make a run at the title and the Pereira fight wouldn't have done him any favors there.  Shavkat is more dangerous to him no doubt, but that fight gets him way closer into title talks.
