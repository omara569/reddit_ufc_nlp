Is Usman undersized for MW? Here he is with Islam talking about fighting him.

    Yes he is smaller for MW but he has always been wildly strong and has a 76 inch reach (Khamzat 75, Costa 72 for comparison).

    Damn. Burns has a 71" reach.
  
    Khamzat might be getting touched up here.

    He’s got long arms and is juiced to the gills. He’ll be ok

    He's 6"0' tall - the same height as Robert Whittaker, Dricus Du Plessis, Marvin Vettori and Paulo Costa.
  
    He's only 2 inches shorter than Khamzat but has a 1 inch reach advantage (76 in vs 75 in).
  
    Weight wise, he walks around at about 86kg/190lbs to 90kg/200lbs from what I can find. He hasn't fought in over 6 months and was probably just starting a fight camp if the Belal rumours were true, so he was probably at the upper end of that range
  
    Meanwhile Khamzat was 98.5kg/217lbs 6 months ago.
  
    Usman is not terribly undersized for middleweight.

    Sounds like khamzat will be around 210 on fight night. Usman will probably be around 195. 15lbs is a pretty good weight advantage and weight matters more in grappling than it does with striking and grappling will likely play a big role in their match up

    I think people make way too big a deal about size when someone moves up. Mostly every two division champion there has ever been started at the lower weight class and moved us. Jones, DC, Cejudo, Conor, GSP the list goes on. We just watched Volk do way better against the ‘bigger strong weight bully wrestler’ than guys in his own division did.
  
    I think there is an argument that the guy one weight class down would be harder than the guy one weight class up for you. We all broadly agree the smaller fighters have much more skill and endurance. When they come in fresh, no weight cut to face a heavier and depleted guy I think it may be an advantage and not a disadvantage.

    Weight classes in MMA make bigger jumps than in boxing cuz there are less divisions in the UFC, therefore it's definitely impressive to move up. I think there are six weight classes between 145-170 in boxing but only three in MMA.

    Islam is 200 pounds outside of fight camp. He floats around 185 and with 1 or 2 bad eating days easily get up past 200.. usman looks like he’s in fight shape in the video..
