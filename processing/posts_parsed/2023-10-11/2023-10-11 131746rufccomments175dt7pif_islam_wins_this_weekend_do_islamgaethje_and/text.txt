    Gamrot asked for Charles also in his post fight speech lol I guess it worked out for him.

    To be honest Justin should be in there instead of Volk. Islam hasn‚Äôt defended once in his division lol. I thought Gamrot was the backup too. Maybe Dana needs to put up a good show for them oil princes ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
