Why I don't see it being Cannonier. He has a fight coming up. He's a striker, not a wrestler. He's old (40 next year). I don't think he would take the fight.

    last fight he fought like he was barely entering his prime but yeah valid points khamzat on short notice is too much risk considering if he gets another win he possibly gets a title shot

    Pull Cannonier out, have him fill In for Costa and have the Khamzat fight be a contenders match to determine who gets the next shot at the winner of Dricus vs Strickland (since Cannonier said that's the only condition he'd accept to fight Khamzat) and have the winner of Craig vs Allen fight Dolidze next Instead.
  
    That and also Usman and Belal moving up to fight Khamzat wouldn't make sense since their not even ranked In the division, especially since Khamzat wants the quickest way to a title shot at MW.
  
    Cannonier Is game to fight anybody. If the moneys right, I bet he'd take It.
