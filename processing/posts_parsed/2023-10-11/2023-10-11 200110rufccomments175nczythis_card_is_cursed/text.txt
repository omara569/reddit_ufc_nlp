If that's the current condition of his elbow, does he really expect his fans to take this seriously? We all know you can't fight with an elbow that will open up after blocking a single kick lol

People would say he's scared/ducking the fight.

In reality he has a bad infection in his elbow and he's showing us first hand proof.

In just two months you have made 12 posts about Khamzat. Gotta be a world record for nuthugging.

If the surgery was 3 weeks ago, why does he still have stitches?

You ever have stitches?
