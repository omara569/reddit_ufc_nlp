anybody remember when Eddie Alvarez held Anthony Pettis against the cage for 15 minutes straight to a split decision win and got a title shot off of it over guys like Tony & Khabib?

They were really desperate to make Khabib/Tony around the time as it would have been one of the bigger fights for the time but fell threw multiple times. I think it was because Eddies fights were generally more fan friendly/bigger draw and his style worked well off of RDAs. From a straight business perspective, it would be much morebetter to go with Eddie because he had so many impressive fight in bellator/dream etc

Anthony Pettis was the most overrated UFC fighter of all fucking time. There has never been a more boring fighter. I hate everything about him, and I am so glad he is fucking gone.

Seriously wtf? He was amazing with the kicks and thzn submitted Henderson! I was convinced he would be Ã  dominant champ for a while. He got exposed later, but he was a great fighter.
