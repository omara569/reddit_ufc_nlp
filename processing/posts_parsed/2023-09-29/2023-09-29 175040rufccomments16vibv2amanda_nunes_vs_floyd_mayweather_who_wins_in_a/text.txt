Currently having this debate with some friends, curious to hear your thoughts.        I personally have Floyd winning, due to physical advantages as well as his superior stand up game. My friends are firm on the stance that Nunes wins, as she has training in various techniques rather than just boxing, and could take the fight to the ground and win. I stated guys like Stipe have had successful careers despite having limited variety in fighting style, though they dismissed this idea. What do you guys think?        Also preferably, answer as if we were simulating the fight 10 times. Which fighter would come out victorious the most out of 10 bouts?Amanda Nunes Vs. Floyd Mayweather. Who wins in a hypothetical street fight?

Floyd ends her and separates her from this dimension with the first combination…she wouldn’t even see it

This times 1000.

Floyd’s a power puncher in the women’s Divison.

He’s also landing at will.

Amanda Nunes is a pioneer in WMMA and the absolute goat but Floyd still wins with zero difficulty. Your friends are idiots, no offence

Dude said "mayweather wins on points" in a street fight

He was referring to his Boxing bouts, stating that Floyd only wins off of points, not off of actual damage being done.

Floyd would kill her without trying

Before floyd was money he was pretty boy mayweather and he could bang, no chance Nunes takes one clean
