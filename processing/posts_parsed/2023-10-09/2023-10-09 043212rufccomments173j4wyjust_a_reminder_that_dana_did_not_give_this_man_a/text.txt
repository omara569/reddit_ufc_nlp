Just a reminder that Dana did not give this man a contract but gave it to a guy that lost the fight, but not only lost the fight, he got dominated in that fight! All because he did some taunts. Than Le went on to become ONE FW Champion. With that said, I like him but he did not deserve a contract.

    I did not watch this season but I washed the show since 2020. Since I've watched almost anyone who puts a dominant performance gets a contract, unless their gameplan is takedown and hold

    I read that UFC was offering two more fights but ONE got the hold of him first.

    Dana is an asshole but he does a damn good job, he finds the best of the best time and time again, but with that many talent around you canâ€™t blame him for a few that he missed signing.

    I didn't realize he was on DWCS. I liked him a ton of TUF. Most exciting fighter that season IMO. Not sure why they never gave him a chance.
