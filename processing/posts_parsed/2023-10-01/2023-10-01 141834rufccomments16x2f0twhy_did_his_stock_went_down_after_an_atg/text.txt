Why did his stock went down after an ATG performance against Volkanovski?

    UFC should show a fighters stock as a mysterious bar graph

    I don’t feel like his stock went down, Volk is a phenomenal fighter. Islam is a phenomenal fighter. Two masters were at work.

    same reason khamzat's stock/hype went way down after the gilbert fight even tho he's n11 beating and almost finishing n2. cuz people thought they were going to easily run through their opponents

    Because Volk did better than expected and his fans couldn't cope with him taking an L so it's been non stop Islam disparaging since

    Because it's the first time the elite dagestanis(i.e khabib and islam) have looked beatable. Before this it really seemed like there was no answer

    Islam has been beaten before (his haters bring it up at every point)

    Islams stock didn’t go down.
  
    He beat two P4P top 3 fighters within four months. Only fighter in the history of UFC to do this. He looked great considering the shorter rehydration time.
  
    Also, his striking was… dare I say, elite… wow crazy saying it, but Islam stood toe to toe with Volk and won over 50% of the exchanges. Not many can say that.
  
    A win over Volk will age incredibly well. This guys going to be a top 3-5 GOAT after he retires.
