UFC MW Top 8 should get ready for the call. The last thing I want to see is Khamzat get another free win pad against wing chun fighters or rank 21 meerscherat

    Realistically thinking:
  
    Izzy - wont fight cos hes career is on tilt after the strickland loss and if he wins it wouldnt win over the fans if he got a title rematch
  
    DDP - contender for the title match no way he will risk it lol
  
    Whittaker - ??
  
    Jared - ??
  
    Marvin - hes said no?

    Cannonier should 100% take it. If he beats Khamzat he will be next for the belt. Ufc will probably save Dricus for Adesanya if Adesanya declines rematch with Strickland

    Feed him to Whittaker. THAT would be a good fight.
