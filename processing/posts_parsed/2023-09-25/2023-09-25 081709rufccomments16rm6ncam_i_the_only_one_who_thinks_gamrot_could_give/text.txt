am i the only one who thinks Gamrot could give Charles issues? yes Mateusz lost to Beneil who Charles destroyed, but Gamrot took Dariush down 4 times, and Beneil took Charles down. Gamrot also has a better chin than Beneil, i could see him wrestlefucking Charles, anybody agree?

    Idk I feel like Charles kinda pulled guard in the beneil fight. Tbh I think Charles ground game is too good to get “wrestle fucked” by anyone so I doubt it

    lmao no
  
    Scamrot is a fraud. Dropped by Jailin, dropped by Beneil, dropped by Arman, dropped by Guram. His chin isn't good/

    i maintain that all of those knockdowns are not from Gamrot being hurt, but him not seeing the punch, due to being blind
  
    if he truly got rocked, he would at least be wobbly after eating it but he never seems hurt after it. he has a titanium chin, now that he has clear vision he wont get dropped no more

    Wasn't he losing to fiziev prior to the injury? I remember it being kinda even slightly leaning fiziev.
  
    Either way, no, gamrot doesn't beat Charlie Olives unless he also gets injured or some shit

    Rafael was probably ahead in points but it def could've gone either way had he not injured himself

    The standup is key and I'd favor Charles heavily. If Gamrot recklessly takes him down in the beginning and can avoid getting submitted he can potentially win but its a longshot.

    Charles would find his chin and most likely finish him. Gamrot doesn’t have a very notable chin.

    Don't listen to anyone in this thread who says Gamrot couldn't give him any problems.
  
    They're in the top 10 of the most stacked division, there are no easy fights for anyone
