Anderson remains on the Mount Rushmore of UFC fighters.

MMA is the only global sport where illegal drug abuse is completely ignored and the cheaters are considered GOATs.

Whereas in other sports, all the accomplishments go away almost immediately once you are found abusing PEDs.

Adesanya still his a chance to be a goat if he still has the will to fight. If he can regain his title and beat sean, ddp, and probably khamzat, I'd say he'd be up there again. He just looked defeated against Sean though so idk.

No mate. He’s lost it twice now. He lost at light heavyweight also whilst Anderson beat former champs in their prime there. Anderson was undefeated champ for 6 years, Izzy for 3.
