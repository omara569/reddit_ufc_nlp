    ... goddamn you're done yet?
  
    As someone who lives in an area where this describes everyone, and my entire town is full of Bryce's, this was the most accurate comment

    Never thought I'd leave this comment on r/ufc but what he's describing is actually critical to understanding political and cultural shifts in the United States. He got tripped up in mixing the fertilizer issue with the pesticide issue, but both issues represent a captured economy.
  
    If you're a farmer, which in Arkansas if you're anywhere but the few small cities they have, you are a farmer, you are planting what makes you money. One of the best ways to improve your yield is to prevent or block weeds. So let's say what makes you money is soybeans, no problem - monsanto has a roundup ready gmo soybean seed for you. Planting your crop with these seeds means you can dump roundup right onto your crop and everything else will die but your plants.
  
    Ok, so you have this crop of soybeans that made it through without succumbing to weeds. It did really well in fact so you want to save some of your seeds for next season. Sorry, that's not in the TOS for using monsanto soybean seeds. You can't reuse, you have to buy new every time you want to plant.
  
    And not just you, those seeds are patented you see. So your neighbor who didn't do business with monsanto at all but got pollinated by a bee who visited your lot and theirs... well that neighbor can be sued for using the new patented gmo seeds without purchasing a license from monsanto.
  
    So that's the weed killer version of what he's saying. There's also the pesticide version and the fertilizer version, there's gmo versions for drought, heat, etc. All of that technological process is great, but it captures the economy of farmers and forces them all - by choice or not - to play by monsanto's (or the other handful of companies') rules.
  
    There's so much more, but it's a very serious issue and one in which most non-rural people have no clue about but very key in understanding why there's so much distrust in rural communities of the big city fed/elites. They see it for what it is, the government does nothing to stop this shit because they're in bed with the lobbyists for these companies and it's just never ending.
