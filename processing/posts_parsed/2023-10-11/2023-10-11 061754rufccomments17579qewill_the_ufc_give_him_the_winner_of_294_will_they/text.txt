Will the ufc give him the winner of 294? Will they make him fight arman if he beats dariush? Charles already beat the entire top 5 thatâ€™s not Islam.

    Oh hell nah ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Charles does not deserve to be on 300 unless they have like 3 titles on the line and itâ€™s the first title fight on the card.

    He can always wait it out at this point. But the way things go he might fight someone who enters top 5 in next year

    If he wants Islam to beat him again, he needs to beat the top 5 again.
  
    Last fight wasn't even competitive, let's hope he can level up before another fight.
