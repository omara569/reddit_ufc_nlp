Trash win, even trashier call. Not weight baring at all.

Congrats on the win by DQ and never stepping foot in UFC ever again. Two fighters that lost got contracts tonight by doing the opposite of what he did.

Not sure what his strategy was even before he Aljamainâ€™d at the end. A dumb decision W was not going to get him a contract.

What's crazy about that weight bearing bullshit is I'm pretty sure I saw Silva (Believe it was that fight) land a way more convincing grounded knee maybe even two and the ref just did nothing. This grounded kneeing shit needs too be addressed it's way too vague.

The Nevada rules are completely fucked. At the very minimum they need to have the unified rules that literally everywhere else fucking has.

Honestly the UFC should just adopt ONE FC ruleset, Superior in every single way. Grounded knees make no sense to prohibit at all. They also need to not allow fighters to stall as much as they do.

The rule is so dumb. If any fighters takes a W in this situation they are playing the game and avoiding the fight.

The bartender asks "Why the long face?"  The man replies "I just found out my wife is sleeping with another man. I've decided I'm going to drink myself to death."    The bartender looks shocked and says "I'm sorry I can't help you kill yourself."     The man asks "Well what would you do in my situation?"         The bartender puffs himself up a bit and says "If I found out a guy was sleeping with my wife I wouldn't sit around feeling sorry for myself, I'd kill the guy."  The man jumps up from his stool and shouts "That's a great idea! Thanks!" and runs out of the bar.   A couple hours goes by and the bartender is starting to get nervous when the man walks back into the bar with a smile on his face.        "Did you kill the guy?" The bartender asks nervously.         "Nope! I slept with your wife. Whiskey please."
