Where do Gaethje and Oliveira stand in terms of their LW title shots ? Would you guys like to see a rematch for the No1. contender spot?

    Gaethje deserves it more at this point. Poirer is a better opponent than dariush

    Forgetting Charles finished both Poirier, Dariush and Gaethje himself just in the last two years..

    Gaethje deserves the title shot.
  
    He fought down vs Fiziev then fought up and avenged his loss to Dustin.

    He didn't fight down, he was fighting someone coming off a long win streak while he himself was coming off a loss
  
    Rankings don't mean much

    I’d rather Gaethje got the next shot now. I just really hope Dana doesn’t let Islam go up and fight Leon/Colby after only defending the 155 Belt against the same 145er twice and not another actual 155 contender.

    Oliveira will never get a title shot ever again. We know how Dana feels about injuries.

    dude has missed weight like 6 (?) times, by 10 pounds once, lost a bunch, lost his belt to the scale, and he's still here, I think he'll get that shot maybe after Gaethje but I think he will get it

    Olives doesn't have to prove ANYTHING to get the rematch. But shit that rematch with Gaethje will be an absolute war i think

    I think Justin should get the title shot if we're being fair.
