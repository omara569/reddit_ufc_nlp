    After his last perfomance I actually favor him heavily over Jiri

    Me to but jiri for some reason tends to find a way. I know he has a chin but If alex gets him on the button idk. Jiri is the underdog so I’m going to put a little money on him.

    Jiri last opponents was Reyes and Glover. Alex is a big step up and Glover has sharpened his wrestling as we saw against Jan. Alex will find holes in Jiri unorthodox striking style. Betting the house on Alex

    Jiri’s putting him out with his relentless pace and pressure. Nobody leaves a Jiri fight with their face intact
