Do MMA fans like to pretend their fight predictions were obvious from the start and shit on others for even thinking the opposite outcome was plausible?

    Bro you have people arguing that DDP was the obvious favorite against ROBERT F. WHITTAKER. So yes, they do that from time to time.

    Internet MMA fans. Irl it's much harder to lie.
  
    I was wrong about:
  
    Adesanya/Strickland Poirier/Gaejthe Sterling/Cejudo
  
    I was right about:
  
    O'Malley/Sterling Jones/Gane Makhachev/Volkanovski
  
    So far I'm about 50/50.

    So you started predicting only this year? Why is that?

    This one was fucking obvious. It wasn't obvious how it happened and how quickly, but everyone I knew put $ on Jones. My dumbass had him winning by ko/tko... still salty about that tbh

    Everything is obvious after the fact. Jones had videos and images where he looked fat, slow, and washed. Many people thought Jones would not be able to find a clinch and would get pieced up on the feet. In hindsight that was wrong, but it was not unreasonable given the data at the time.

    Reminder that Jon Jones was a underdog for this fight

    He wasn't... Just because when the books opened jones had a + next to his name for a few days doesn't mean he was an underdog. Check the odds the night before/of the fight.

    This is Fake news, nobody ever refers to fight odds as the opening line.
