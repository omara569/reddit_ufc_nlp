UFC fans argue all the time, this is the one fight that will unite us all. Right?

    I'd love to see Tony win and leave the UFC with his head held high.
  
    It pains me to think Paddy could have Tony's name on his list of wins and realistically, this is the most likely outcome.
  
    Tony is half the fighter he used to be and it will honestly disturbing and a bit upsetting to see him beaten by a disrespectful cocky prick that wouldn't have lasted half a round in Tony's prime.

    With Tony being (I think) 0-6 at this point, he probably can't be too picky.  A lot of guys get cut at even 0-3!
  
    And Tony deserves some big names at this point in his career.  I'm okay with this fight.
  
    How many fights does Tony have left on his contract?

    The better question is how many fights does Tony have left in his body. Dude might actually leave the cage as a ghost, hell ir looked like he was a goner after the Chandler KO.
