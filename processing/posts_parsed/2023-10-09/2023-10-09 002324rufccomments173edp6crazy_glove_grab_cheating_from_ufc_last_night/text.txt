    This is one area where boxing is better. Refs in boxing actually take points. Some refs don't fuck around and don't even give warnings.

    I think there are way too many warnings given out during the fights. Each fighter should get one warning. In the locker room, before the fight even starts. Start taking points immediately and the blatant cheating will stop.
  
    Edit: I didn't get a warning that my spelling was wrong.

    You did get a warning about spelling. In the classroom, before the comment even started
