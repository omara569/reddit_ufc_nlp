    Watching Bryce grapple is incredibly fun.   The part where he was underneath Ige on his back, and just edged around and shifted his way into mount was amazing.
  
    Dude is too good at that shit.  Needs to tighten up his standup a bit more so nobody can Topuria him again.

    Yeah even given his mental handicap he is a good grappler and all around entertaining fighter to watch. He actually goes for submissions and to a dirty casual like myself his style actually keeps my attention.

    As a redneck, I must first say that Bryce doesn’t represent us, but bless his heart if he doesn’t make me cry laughing with his simple Jack of the octagon antics.

    Is it fair to say THIS is what I’m looking for in a “wrestler” fight? This is entertaining ground work which I’m fine watching just as much as striking

    I'm talking jujitsu not wrestling, that's not a wrestling transition.
