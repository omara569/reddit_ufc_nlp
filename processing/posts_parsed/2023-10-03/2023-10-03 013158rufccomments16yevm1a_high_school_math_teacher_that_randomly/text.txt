A high school math teacher that randomly discovered he was a badass and became middleweight champion of the UFC. Rich is a class act and I wish there were more like him in todays UFC....

This guy was the GOAT until he ran into Anderson Silva. His KO over Quarry was amazing.

I saw an interview where Quarry claimed that was an early stoppage and therefor should get an immediate rematch.   He claimed his hands where still up in a defensive manner when he hit the canvass.

Wow.

I watched that body kick a dozen times, and then a dozen times more in slo-mo.

The dude's entire torso balloons from the impact! Brutal.
