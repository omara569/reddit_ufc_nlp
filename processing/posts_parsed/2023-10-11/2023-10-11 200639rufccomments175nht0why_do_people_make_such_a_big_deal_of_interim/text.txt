Why do people make such a big deal of interim titles? Lack of ‘respect’ for the champ doesn’t mean less money. And the champ gets a break

Do interim fighters get PPV points when they do the unification fight? If so, 100% I’m for the.  Otherwise, yeah they’re no more than a glorified “official” #1 contender

Yea they do. And I'd assume most contracts give a pay bump if youre a champion.  Like I remember ages ago Poirier talking about signing his first UFC contract with champion clauses or conditions
