Absolutely, especially in Philly (where Eddie is from) with blue collar guys they see you as a pussy. My single mom growing up was so embarrassed using food stamps she would hide the card when sliding it and would only use self checkout. I think the culture has changed a bit in Philly but years ago my mom said that it was a big deal if a man with no kids was on welfare

I'm sure it had a massive impact on McGregor in the fight......

Mcgregor had some massive impacts on alvarezs head in the fight. Beat the welfare out of him

Pretty sure mcg has paid back his dole payments and then some by now. That's what we pay tax for

That’s not how welfare works? Just silliness

If anything that speaks more about McGregor's greatness. He worked his way up from such a situation to eventually becoming the money fight that Alvarez himself begged for. So what does that make Alvarez?

I always thought this insult was overhyped. Broke people can't use welfare? Lol
