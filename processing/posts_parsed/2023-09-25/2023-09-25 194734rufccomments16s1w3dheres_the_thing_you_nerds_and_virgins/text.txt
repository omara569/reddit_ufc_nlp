    Bryce - unintentionally funny
  
    Strickland - naturally funny
  
    Colby - roll the dice on whether the next thing he says will be regular cringe or so cringe it’s funny after he stumbles over his prerecorded lines

    I always find Strickland hilarious. Sometimes Colby has some good one liners and I enjoy his cringe for the most part. Bryce the other night....I had to mute the TV from secondhand embarrassment.

    Other than being white Sean O’Malley couldn’t be any more different than all three of these guys.
