No need to talk much.        Just for this 2023 year.        -He fcked up the originally planned UFC 284 co-main with Robert Whittaker earlier this year. -He fcked up the Ikram Aliskerov fight at UFC 291. -He f*cked up again the UFC 294 co-main.        -Just enough is enough, Paulo Costa got no reliability and is causing more trouble to the promotion than anything.If the withdrawal for the UFC294 co-main is official now, the UFC should cut Paulo Costa.

    Hold on. The UFC is the one who keeps advertising Paulo fights that aren't actually booked. Now they're gonna cut him for "pulling out" of fights he never even agreed to? The fuck lmao
  
    If he pulls outta this one I do agree it's a major blue ball moment but it's only one fight he's actually pulled out of. Oliveira should also be cut if you follow this logic.

    What about Bobby and Cannonier fights back in 2021?
  
    Or how about his only fight in 2021 being against Marvin? You know, the fight where two days before the weight in he said "I'm not cutting to 185" then Marvin said "I don't care about weight, let's fight at 195" and they agreed to. Then Costa said "I'm not cutting to 195" and Marvin said "fine let's fight at 205" and gave Costa nowhere else to run and whooped his ass.
  
    The dude is a fucking a joke, people defending him are lame as fuck. He may not have signed a contract against Bobby back in February, but he sure as shit verbally agreed to it if the UFC marketed it. He was just using his contract as an excuse and thought if the UFC already marketed it he'd have some leverage.

    This loser hasn’t even looked like a top 10 middleweight in 4 years. Guy was talking all this shit about how this is the new Costa best shape of his life vs Rockhold.. lame performance.. and out another 14 months.. he’s the least active while supposedly in his prime.. this is a fighter who no longer believes in himself.

    He also pulled out of the Whittaker and Cannonier fights in 2021.

    He had a staph infection lol
  
    The Whittaker and Iskram fights were never agreed by Paulo.
  
    The Marvin fight was indefensible tho.

    I don't think they'll cut him straight up, his memes still have some people convinced he's a top 5 guy so UFC can still milk that by building off other up and comers off him. They're in it to make money and not friends but he's gotta be on thin fucking ice rn.

    Why would they cut him for withdrawing from this fight, it's pretty clear that he got a pretty bad infection and had to have surgery on it? sure the other times you can say it's his fault, whether he agreed to the bobby fight or not I don't know but this one for sure it's his fault

    Only contract Paulo signed was for Khamzat. Never signed for Whitaker or Aliskerov. He was saying for months leading up to both fights that he never signed for them. That’s the typical UFC shit announcing and promoting a fight that isn’t signed to try to force a fighter to sign.
