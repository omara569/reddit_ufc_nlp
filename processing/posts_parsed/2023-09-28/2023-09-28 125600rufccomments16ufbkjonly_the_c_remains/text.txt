is there a lore reason for him to not wear yellow trunk on gaethje fight?

He weighed in heavy by .5 pounds and thus had to vacate the title. It was the night of the fight though, so they just said fuck it and let him wear champ trunks regardless, also he wasnâ€™t officially stripped until the very first round started. The whole thing was kind of controversial too, and thereâ€™s some theorizing the Justin may have been getting a home state advantage.

Crazy feat if he clears out the top 5. Kinda leaning on him to win over Islam
