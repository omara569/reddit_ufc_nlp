Fighter gets a one sided beatdown... Cruz: Almighty praises for the ref for letting them be a warrior.
Quite frankly, this frequent rant is getting real old now.

    Dom just can't be professional..he ALWAYS makes a comment about Keith any change he gets. Dude the stoppage was legit you were done.

    Cruz is the worst commentator by far. I can’t stand when he’s on the mic.

    I only speak English, but when Cruz and Bisping are commentating together I just watch the Spanish commentary

    I heard rumours that people smelt cigarettes and alcohol on Cruz’s breath last night

    It was a bullshit stoppage. And Keith has been a fucking drug addict scumbag since he was fronting GFY in the 90s. I know because I was there, lol. Nothing Dom said about this was inaccurate.

    Tired of hearing Cruz whine it’s getting old and annoying he actually has a lot of IQ but it’s often drowned out due to the constant whining he does… Waterson-Gomez is a warrior for taking that beating but I honestly think it should’ve been stopped earlier in the fight
