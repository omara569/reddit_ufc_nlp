    Strickland beating Adesanya is probably the most surprising thing Iâ€™ve seen since I started watching the UFC. I thought DDP had a chance because of Bobbyâ€™s chin so it wasnâ€™t what I expected but it was unsurprising.
  
    Part of me honestly still canâ€™t believe Strickland won ðŸ˜‚

    Strickland beating Adesanya
  

    This might be the biggest upset in MW history. Silva was 38 when got knocked out, DDP looked good against Till if you count in that he had problems with his nose which was fixed before his fight against Robert and Izzy knocked down Pereira before in kickboxing so him KO ing alex in the rematch could also happen but Strickland dominating Izzy !?!? Never see that one coming.................

    Dricus because of the way he won. It wasnt some lucky ko and he took and held Rob down in r1.

    When I watch Strickland and think of his style, hes truly underrated af and I always knew he was solid. After I saw him drop Izzy, the fight made more sense to me why it ended up the way it did. Izzy just gave up too much ground and Sean stayed patient. Izzy didnt really use his boxing, he was too busy trying that question mark kick and Sean was checking all the leg kicks. Sean is reactive af but Izzy made his plan too obvious. A head kick ko. Alex set him up better.
  
    Dricus was honestly more shocking to me. He looks so sloppy and struggled with Till. Ig he timed Whittaker's darts with a perfect jab and just rocked him. I'm surprised he hurt Rob that bad but he did run into it. I feel bad for Rob, I wonder where he'll go from here.

    As they say, there is always a striker's chance. There is even the grappler's chance.
  
    But there is no such thing as "dominating 5 rounds" chance.
  
    Sean, the way he won, nobody expected that.
