    Just got back from the future. That fight was a real banger. Craziest part was when Herb Dean got hit with an accidental elbow and was knocked unconscious. Volk ended up knocking Justin out with an overhand right.
  
    All of a sudden, though, Khabib jumps into the octagon with a steel chair and hits Volk over the head, staggering him. At this point, DC us losing his shit "BAW GAWD ITS KHABIB WITH A STEEL CHAIR! THAT SON OF A BITCH!" Then Khabib hits Justin twice more, opening up a nasty cut on Volk's bald head.
  
    Justin finally comes to and gets back up and looks at Khabib standing over Volks' lifeless body and the two men lock eyes. Khabib extends his hand toward Justin and moves to embrace him. Just when Justin goes to return the gesture, Khabib hits him in the gut with the chair and whollops Justin over the head as well.
  
    Both men lay motionless on the ground, and Khabib is barely able to escape over the cage before Herb regains consciousness. When Herb finally regains his bearings, he just sees the fighters lying on the ground and has to call a draw.
  
    Absolutely nutso.
