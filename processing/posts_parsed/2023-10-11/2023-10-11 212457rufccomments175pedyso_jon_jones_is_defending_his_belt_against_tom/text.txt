I would've thought UFC prob just waiting for the last moment to sign another contract like they wait for a fighter to fight out his contract but after reading that statement even if UFC was gonna re-sign they prob won't now lol what do they mean by "have other plans"?

Are there other organizations like USADA out there that UFC is planning to contract for testing or something? I don't see UFC dropping testing all together but they prob just want more control over the process and USADA said NO.
