So Gamrot is the back up for Islam vs Charles 2 right? Yes, but actually no. Poor Gamrot.

    No one wants to watch Islam dry hump Gamrot for 5 rounds, put in Volk

    Idk why people hate Gamrot, he is obviously always game, ready to step in, fought Jalin Turner on short notice.. ready to step in here.. just appreciate the guy is at least trying to fight or save the fights

    Forget Gamrot. Poor Ilia. A day ago we were hyped for his title fight against Volk in January.

    Beneil made him look like an amateur in that fight.

    Precisely. Gamrot wants to go out there and roll around the mat for 25 minutes just like Beneil "swinging at air and punching the mat" Dariush. At least Charles, Alex, and even Islam look for finishes.

    I would have preferred Gaethje over Volk but those two are way better than Gamrot.
  
    His best wins are Arman(shit decision) and Fiziev who got injured mid fight so we couldnt tell who was gonna win.
  
    Even on paper he doesnt match Islam in striking, wrestling nor experience

    he didn't even earn the title shot, he had a decision win to jalin, lost to Beneil and lost most of the Fiziev fight and won by injury lol

    Yeah I agree he didn't earn the title shot but I don't get why people run with this narrative that he was on his way to losing the Fiziev fight. The fight ended WAY too early to be able to make any judgement on that, and it ain't like Fiziev dominated, Fiziev got in one flashy combo and people act like Gamrot was getting destroyed.
