Prime Randy Couture vs Prime Rampage Jackson. Who wins?

I think Randy takes it. Durable enough to not get one-shit by rampage, high level wrestling, control, and dirty boxing.

Would be a great fight to see though. Slam-page could do some serious damage

An original post on r/ufc?!

I’d want to give it to Randy. He and rampage exist on two opposite extremes of the fight iq spectrum, and I could legit see him just out-pointing/wrestling Randy across 25 minutes, and maybe even get a finish if Rampage gasses out quick enough. The KO threat would def be there, but that’s something Randy’s dealt with plenty of times.

I’m just surprised they never fought

I'm not. The beginning of Rampage's LHW Prime, Randy had moved back up to Heavyweight to challenge Tim Sylvia. By the time he was back at LHW, he knew he only had a few fights left, so he fought Mark Coleman, jumped back up to Heavyweight to fight James Toney, then retired after getting Crane Kicked by Machida.

Rampage was busy knocking out Chuck, taking Hendo to a decision, and being cool as fuck.

Everyone forgetting what Chuck did to Couture? And what rampage did to Chuck? Mma math doesn’t always make sense but in this case it does.

Couture isn’t a beast on the feet, and if you’re able to keep him there you got it. Rampage’s wrestling skills and takedown defense was way better then chuck’s going against the likes of Kevin Randleman. So he probably would be able to keep the fight standing, with his great power and standup rampage should be able to get it done.
