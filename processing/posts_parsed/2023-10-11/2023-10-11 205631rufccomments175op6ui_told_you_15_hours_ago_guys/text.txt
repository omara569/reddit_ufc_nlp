This is the right move by Dana,        Kamaru is higher on P4P than Costa, DDP and even Izzy and Strickland.        Usman beat Sean before and he would deserve a shot at MW title if he wins        This is a bigger name for Khamzat than Paulo and Chimaev would deserve to get a MW title shot if he wins.        Yes I know Usman isnâ€™t ranked in MW, but he is still very high on the P4P.        This fight is going to be insane.        Islam, Volk, Usman and Chimaev all in one card.        When was the last time 3 top 10 P4P fighter fought on the same card?        ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯I told you 15 hours ago guys

Technically you posted the infamous arm, which could be any number of fighters.

I turn my phone off for 8 hours today and I come back to half of the 294 main card changing.

Usman v Khamzat is a good fight but FUCK I wanted to see him scrap with Costa. They spent 6 months building that fight up
