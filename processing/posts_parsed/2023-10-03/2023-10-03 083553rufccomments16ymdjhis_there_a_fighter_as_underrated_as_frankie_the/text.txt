is there a fighter as underrated as Frankie "The Answer" Edgar? beat BJ Penn thrice, Charles Oliveira, Cub Swanson twice, Stephens, Faber, Munhoz, Maynard, Sherk &finished Yair Rodriguez & KO'd Chad Mendes. + arguably got robbed against Benson Henderson, Frankie is a legend, wish he got more respect

    Was absurdly undersized for the vast majority of his career too, and kept whooping ass. OG BMF

    Definitely OG BMF, remember his fights with Maynard as some of the first fights I ever saw. I was amazed at the punishment he took, and then to KO Maynard, like damn this dude is tough.

    I think everyone respects Frankie. A true warrior. But he shouldve retired like 5 fights ago. He's been on the wrong end of some real nasty KO's.

    The Maynard fights were fucking epic. He's one of my favorites.

    The second fight with Maynard was bananas. He came back from a round that could potentially be scored 10-7 by todayâ€™s criteria to fight Gray to a draw, was absolutely wild.

    Frankie might very well have been the most respected fighter in the whole sport while he was competing. Even the most cancerous mma fans can't really hate on a guy that won almost every fight he had against guys that were signifigantly heavier than him. People just don't talk about him much because his time is over and there's always lots of of active fighters to focus on.
