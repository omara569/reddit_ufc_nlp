people are going to pay 90$ too thinking this is the best vs the best when it’s just creating narratives and storylines

For real , the storylines are going to get so much better after Vince steps in.

They aren’t really selling it as best vs best though, it’s more about Sean avenging his only loss.

Yeah I mean I don’t mind it, it just delegitimises the belt a bit when the best guy is clearly looking past the next reasonable contenders for his next fight. It’s like a lesser version of when Bisping held up middleweight to get revenge against old Hendo and a GSP moneyfight. I get it from Sean’s end, just feel for the elite guys that have to wait around at bantamweight because of it

Huh? He beat Pedro tho, and won 4 fights in a row before losing to sandhagen, who is a straight killer, nothing to be ashamed of losing to him. Strange post

He beat Muhnoz, and quite easily. People really need to stop looking at just stats because Muhnoz's high cardio output but no damage style looks good on stat sheets but doesn't actually mean he's winning. Chito was lighting him up with heavy shots all fight.

Munhoz is ranked 10. Aljo, Merab, Cejudo, Sandhagen and Yan all deserve a shot before Vera does.

But that doesn't matter, because the UFC isn't a meritocracy and people need to get over that. It's not the Olympics. It's a business.

Chito beat Sean before, so that fight sells tickets. That's what matters in a business and gets priority. I'm not saying it's right and I wish MMA was more merit based too, but it's a business and people need to get over it.

I mean Sean Strickland didn't deserve his shot and look how that turned out.

Omalley didn't clear out an entire division like izzy
