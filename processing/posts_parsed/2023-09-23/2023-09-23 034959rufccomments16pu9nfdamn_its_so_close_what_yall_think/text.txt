I think the timing and luck played into Colbys favor. He now has 10 rounds of tape to study of Leon vs Usman 2 & 3 and his own 10 rounds against Usman. This could be a significant advantage sitting out for a long time preparing for just 1 guy.        I'm convinced Sean would not beat Izzy if he did not lose to Alex first. The Alex fight sent him back to make adjustments on his striking defense to avoid getting KO'd againDamn it's so close, what y'all think?

    Mike Bell has it 25% Edwards, 25% Covington. 50% Grasso.

    If its the same Colby that showed up vs Usman i think he can put a pace on Leon and take a dec. But ring rust might play a factor (even though Leons been out a while too)

    You do know Leon fought in march 2023 right? Colby last fought in march 2022 so you canâ€™t say Colby has ring rust then say Leon has too. I think Leon would have fought Gilbert had Gilbert not overestimated himself and fought Belal a month after Jorge

    I meant to say he would have fought Gilbert at July or august

    Leon wins imo. Hes better everywhere and has power

    He's better everywhere? Would love to see Leon out wrestle him.
