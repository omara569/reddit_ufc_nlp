Is he just a genuine alcoholic at this point? It seems exceedingly rare to see a public appearance from him (or even a private one that he has filmed himself) where he isn't drinking.

I swear these machines just record how fast the bag goes up and doesn't actually take the full power of the punch to measure correctly.

It has been a long time since highschool but I will give it a shot. Since the mass of the bag is constant, you should be able to roughly approximate power (I mean that in a physics sense, not an MMA sense) and kinetic energy by measuring the velocity of the bag and then extrapolating from there

Conor's always had a good punch. It's a shame he didn't stick around. Could have had some banger fights.

Big part of me wishes the Mayweather fight never happened for a multitude of reasons

Justin Gaethje also hit a punching machine this week, and hit it so hard it broke

Iâ€™ve hit one of these and got 921 and thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™m stronger than either of them
