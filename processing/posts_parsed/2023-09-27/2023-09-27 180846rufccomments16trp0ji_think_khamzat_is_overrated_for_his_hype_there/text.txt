I think khamzat is overrated for his hype. There are so many undefeated fighters in the UFC. 12-0 is normal. Even Costa was 13-0 before losing to Izzy.

12-0 is “normal” for someone making their UFC debut after winning 1 DWCS fight and having 11 other wins against people with a combined career record of 1-14-1.

12-0 and ranked in the top 10 of a weight class is far from normal.

Also, Costa being 13-0 pre Izzy is impressive as hell.

What was it, 1 punch received in 5 fights or something? Plus him carrying The Leech over to Dana just so he could talk to him

Also when he ragdolled Holland, seeing my favorite fighter get tossed around like a salad was not a great feeling lmao

Across his first four fights in the UFC, Khamzat Chimaev was struck twice. Perfect records are one thing, but perfect performances are another.

Costa wasn’t as dominant as Khamzat

He also lost on TUF

His hype is generating from his actual performances not just because he has a 0. People used to say the same thing about khabib but people could tell he was special when watching his fights.

Khamzat has made every opponent but one look like a complete amateur there are levels

Khamzat has been calling out every living breathing ufc fighter for years now.
