Khamzat will now represent the UAE instead of Sweden in the UFC. For those who don't know, it's nearly impossible for foreigners to get a Citizenship in the UAE given the many tax benefits

    You can represent any country you wish without being a citizen of it. Nasrat recently fought under the Moroccan flag while heâ€™s a German citizen and ethnically from Afghanistan.
  
    Khamzat is picking UAE flag because of Swedish laws that permits burning of religious books.

    I guess it helps to be embraced by a country that is enthralled by your athletic ability in the pinnacle of all sports.

    Why does everyone assume he got a citizenship? You just have to live in a country to represent them. Brock lesnar came out under Canada once because he moved to Saskatchewan.

    He probably has a citizenship given he's a pretty famous guy. Mr wonderful has a citizenship and I think floyd mayweather does too. You just gotta know the right people

    its still annoying to see refugees come in, shit on swede laws, and cause corruption in the Swedish land, then shit on the country that gave him a home. Khamzat talks a lot about israel and stuff but he scared of Kadrov same with his counterpart Khabib.
