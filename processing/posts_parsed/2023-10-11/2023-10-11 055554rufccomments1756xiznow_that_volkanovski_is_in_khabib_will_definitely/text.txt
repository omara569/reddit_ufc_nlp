Now That Volkanovski Is In, Khabib Will Definitely Be In Islam’s Corner. Calling It Now.

    What makes you so certain of that? What message does that send to Islam and the entire world for Khabib to essentially say “wow, okay, Volk now?…. You’re going to need me there… you’re going to need all the help you can get, brother…” - that’s essentially the message that it sends, and I don’t think that’s the message Khabib wants to send.
  
    Plus any time Khabib is present, so much media attention goes to him that it detracts from Islam as a fighter… Khabib wants Islam to carve his own path and not live under his shadow.
