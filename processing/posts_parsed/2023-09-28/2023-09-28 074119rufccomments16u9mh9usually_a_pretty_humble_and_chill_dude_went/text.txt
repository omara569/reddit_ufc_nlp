Max showing him how to block is the most savage thing I've see in the UFC followed him Max again screaming yelling at the broadcast team and punching Kattar in the face not even looking at him.

Coaching ortega ranks #1 for me. But, respectfully, #2 has to be when he pointed to the mid of the cage, "imma stand and bang right here." That right there is the coldest ive seen him hahaha

Then again followed by him challenging Lamas to a swang&bang in the center of the cage instead of coasting to a win

Max is such a nice guy, coaching Ortega during his own fight against him.

I don't like Ortega. Yes, he knocked out my favorite fighter in frankie edgar. Yes I have a grudge. But I don't like the guy. Hell of a fighter tho
