    GSP vs Anderson was the Dream matchup for many fans back then

    Aldo going up to beat Pettis for double champ status was going to happen before an injury cut that off, but it would have been awesome to see. Obligatory Tony/Khabib since they both ruled LW for so long and still believe Tony would have made it competitive if we're talking prime vs prime.  Zabit vs Max or Volk.

    Cain Velasquez vs Jon Jones for me. In their prime the two best fighters ever.

    Prime Fedor vs DC on Pride Ring. It's sad how for some reason Fedor become a unidimensional brawler once he went to the west. In their primes I can see both results: DC ko'ing Fedor and Fedor submiting DC
