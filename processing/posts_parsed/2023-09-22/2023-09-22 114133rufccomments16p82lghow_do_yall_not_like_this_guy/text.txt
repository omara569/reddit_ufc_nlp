    I have a feeling he's going to get humiliated judging from his 2 last performances. I hope I'm wrong.

    Yeah, Costa hasn't looked great since the Romero fight tbh, but I think he's taking this fight very seriously so we'll see what happens

    Its such a 50/50, either he gets exposed or he expose Khamzat. Man this month is gonna take forever. Gonna root for Costa, he is too funny.

    Ground and pound KO or standup KO? If itâ€™s the former then I tend to agree. Idk about the latter. Khamzat has decent standup but Costa went to war with Romero.

    The hair transplant didn't work. Paolo got scammed or his juice is just too potent.
