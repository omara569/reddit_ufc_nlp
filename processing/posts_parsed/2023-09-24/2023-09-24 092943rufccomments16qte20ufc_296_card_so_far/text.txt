    Ya, this is easily up there with my favourite 5 fights on a main card ever.
  
    Just an incredible card. I wonder if they load the prelims too. Setting up Paddy, Garry, Shavkat, and Colby for a massive 2024.

    I think alot of people are doubting wonderboy, he looks great for his age and his submission defence is great too, i have shavkat but i doubt itll be a walk in the park

    I really think high of Shavkat and in my eyes I see that guy as a champ in near future but people doubting Wonderboy are not gonna be happy with when they see what happens at 296. Wonderboy is not an easy fight for any fighter no matter what people say, Shavkat was getting hit a lot by Neal and Wonderboy is a fucking sniper, one bad timing and it could be night night. Shavkat has to be near perfect with his defence on this fight.
  
    I’d say we’re in for some big upsets on this card.

    Three fighters on this card I’d like nothing more then to see them get their asses handed to them.
