    Strickland 100%. He was like a 7 to 1 underdog and there were loads of people saying he didn't even deserve the shot...

    BetOnline.AG said 96% of parlays for 293 concluded with Adesanya beating Strickland. He was not supposed to beat him

    I'll be the first to admit I said that. I thought Sean would be embarrassed by what Izzy did to him. Instead

    Out of these, not Justin beating Dustin

    Strickland is #1 imo, but Izzy KOing his personal boogeyman was big

    It’s crazy for so many reasons. Alex rocked Strickland. BFF era began. Alex wins in a Hail Mary versus Izzy. Izzy starches Alex baaaad. Training arc with Strickland and Alex, with pre-fight interviews of Alex saying Strickland truly has a chance to pull it off, only to get called a hater: then the fucking guy really pulls it off.
  
    And if it weren’t for that whole story, #1 would have almost for sure been Izzy finally getting his revenge in a vicious way, only to get nullified by the power of friendship and the fact that no man who jerks off to cartoons can defeat DeSean.

    Would’ve been izzy vs alex, but sean kinda took the light off of that ko. So sean vs izzy

    Just based on the sheer incredibility, DeSean vs Fizzy has to be the biggest. I'd say Justin sleeping Dustin would be second.

    I feel like Justin vs Dustin doesn’t get clipped and reposted nearly as much as other just as old but less meaningful/wild moments. I expected to see this shit 24/7 on at least one sub per week.
