I predict there will be no takedowns landed in this fight.

So do you think it'll be like Usman Colby, where they mutually understood their wrestling was top notch so they just decided to stand up the whole time.

Khamzat will wrestle. He doesn't care.

If he fights the way he fought against burns, I think he loses

Nop, he ragdolled pretty much everyone they gave him. The one he didn't take down was GM3 :)

If Leon can take Usman's back then khamzat can easily get him down lol Khamzat is gonna go 100% as soon as the bell rings just like the Holland fight, He's been itching for a fight.

Khamzat is going to decimate Usman.

I think their wrestling is equal and Kamaru can definitely stuff a lot of Khamzat s takedowns. On the ground though Iâ€™m worried about Usmans lack of grappling and jiu jitsu l.
