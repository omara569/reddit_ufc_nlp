If Volkanovski isn’t already your Featherweight GOAT, what would he have to do? I think Volk is the better fighter but the longevity and pioneering of Aldo makes me slightly lean towards him until further notice.        My thing is, when can he get to a place where it’s clear? People tried to claim Izzy over Anderson and Usman over GSP before it was time, so when would a time of no return be for the Volkanovski GOAT case? Could he lose to Topuria, maybe even twice, and still be your Featherweight GOAT? if so, then there’s no debateJose Aldo Vs Alexander Volkanohski, who’s your featherweight GOAT? What would Volk have to do to seal it for good?

    Pre-Conor Aldo is one of the most deadliest fighters the UFC has ever seen, the guy was (quite literally) unbeatable.
  
    I hope people don’t get confused about how great Aldo was by looking at his overall record after he stuck around a bit too long.

    Frankie was really that guy when Aldo beat him.. Right now it's Aldo still but with Volks performance against Islam, and another couple defenses, he takes it

    It's at 145 and Aldo wasn't allowed to move up

    One or two more defenses against solid contenders. Then we can at least argue strength of schedule and competition. Right now I think Aldo takes it simply because of longevity on top of all the stats.

    I posted above and will state it again. If Volk retired today the answer is Aldo. Therefore, Aldo is still the goat.

    I feel like the consensus is that Volk has the potential to be the GOAT but Aldo is still on top. Numbers and longevity do matter but Volk tried going up and did insanely well against Islam where Aldo never tried. I don’t see anyone beating Volk but I think for now Aldo’s still top dog at 145.
  
    Also I love Max and I’m from Hawaii but hearing Rogan call Max the goat after beating Ortega for a 2nd title defense to Aldo’s 11 at the time was ok but that man throws that word around way too easily

    Aldo wasn't allowed to move up. He had to vacate if he wanted to challenge pettis

    Aldo wasn’t allowed dummy. Dana forced to him to pick
