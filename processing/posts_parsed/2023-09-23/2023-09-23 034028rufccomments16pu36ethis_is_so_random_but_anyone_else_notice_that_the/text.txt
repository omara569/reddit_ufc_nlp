This is so random but anyone else notice that the hardest punchers always have genetically huge delts and the weakest punchers have almost no delt muscles?

    Skinny, no delts, nothing but will sleep you in a second. It mostly comes down to technique. Ofc your body has to be in shape but you dont need to look like Usman to ko a mf

    Also punching form. Mike Tyson used the weight of his body more than any power puncher I've ever seen.

    Power comes from the legs mainly but having a large back also helps distribute that power in your upper body. Also, having larger hands or wrists can help you have more power too because the object you are hitting with has more mass if itâ€™s bigger.
