Late into round 3 Volkanovski becomes a terminator, pummelling Yair in a vicious finishing sequence halting any momentum the challenger was gaining.

    The body shot > uppercut > slam was a thing of beauty.

    One of the sickest displays of skill I feel like I've seen in the sport. It was one of the clearest indicators of just how far above most Volk is

    He was so patient and calculating while also being decisive and devastating.

    Volk improves after every fight its fucking crazy.
  
    He hangs with Islam in wrestling exchanges, then uses what he's learned against Yair to take away his striking.
  
    He's evenly matched against Holloway in their 2nd fight then 50/45s him.

    I think if he comes into this rematch a little more mindful of Islam's striking he can honestly do this.

    Canâ€™t fucking wait. We get a better islam, but volk keeps getting better and better. This will be even crazier than the first fight guaranteed.

    It was the inside leg kick to stance switch to southpaw that did it. Yair returned a rear kick and left himself open to the right lead hook in southpaw and after that big hit it was all downhill.
