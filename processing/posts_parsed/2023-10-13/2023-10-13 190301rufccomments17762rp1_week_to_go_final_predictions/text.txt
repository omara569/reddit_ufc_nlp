One week is too early for final predictions. That's 7 more days of flip flopping left

Odds are too wild to not roll underdogs on main and co-main. Usman I’m a little iffy on with his knee and I think Khamzat is gonna try to wrestle cause of that. Same time Usman has a nice jab and Khamzat is hittable but overall the odds are nice so I’ll roll Usman. Volk almost had it done the first bout. Yeah, he’s late replacement this time around, yeah Islam has Khabib but I mean.. that first fight was fuckin close and I think Volk just goes a little harder this time around knowing he almost snatched victory before. I think Islam is preparing more for Volk this time (which I know he camped Olivera but after their initial bout no doubt he was at the drawing board for Volk) but I think it’s just gonna be a different looking Volk. Basically Islam is gonna be a better version of Islam, Volk is gonna be a different Volk (makes sense in my head.. idk)

As for the rest, Walker is too chinny and I don’t like his ground game. And the other 2 fights I don’t really give a shit about at all so probably make food during those

As much as I want volk to win, I think islam will submit his left arm.

Why wouldn't you? Guy just came out of sugery, put the operated arm in a submission boom.
