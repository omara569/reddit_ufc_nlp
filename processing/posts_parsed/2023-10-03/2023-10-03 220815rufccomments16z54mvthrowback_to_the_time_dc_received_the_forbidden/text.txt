Throwback to the time DC received the forbidden knowledge from Sensei Seagal himself.

How the fuck does anyone take this hack seriously? He knows nothing about fighting and yet somehow conned his way into the UFC inner circle, he is just so full of crap. I can't believe Sensei Seagal wasted his time gifting his forbidden arts to him.

Would love to get DC's take on the 'knowledge' he dropped on him.

He must be massive, he's dwarfing DC

Seagal is the epitome of every big guy who thinks they can beat anyone in a fight

I just think some guys were trying to be creative and unorthodox. I don't think any of these guys drank the kool-aid, they just didn't entirely dismiss aikido. I'm sure it has a thing or two that could be useful. As a complete syle? No.

I wouldnâ€™t say seagall is the most legit martial artist but I do honestly think he might have decent fighting advice here and there sprinkled into the fuckton of bull shit that is his persona
