    Soooo fun.
  
    Remember when Yoel pointed behind Costa to distract him and it looked like Costa almost fell for it? He was going to be like "made ya look!" And swing a wild haymaker.
  
    That was funny as hell.

    I still can't believe that Yoel pointed to something to make Costa look and Costa fucking fell for it lmao.

    One thing I always took away for Yoel is he could never hold top control for long periods of time. His mma wrestling IMO is not the best but his actual wrestling in comps is incredible.

    Yoel beat Cael Sanderson. I’m surprised his wrestling doesn’t translate even better to mma. Yoel’s wrestling credentials are greater than that of Khamzat or Bo.

    This fight took years off both of them. I wish Costa would get more love for the performances he puts on, that rockhold fight was incredible.

    Isn't Costa more or less universally loved here? I don't know of many hate posts about him. The worst has been happening recently with people think they're feeding him to Khamzat and even then at least 50% of the people are hoping he wins.
