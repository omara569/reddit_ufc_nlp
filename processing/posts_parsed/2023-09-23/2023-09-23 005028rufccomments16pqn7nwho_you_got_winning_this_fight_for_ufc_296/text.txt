Who you got winning this fight for ufc 296
I think Tony will finally get a win and hopefully he retires right after (which he won’t)

    This is either going to be the most satisfying thing to watch or the saddest rage inducing thing to watch

    I can’t believe Tony went from longest win streak in LW history to…. being the next can the UFC feeds the barstool fighter.
  
    This might be a sadder story arc than BJ Penn

    I normally never engage in this kind of talk, but Paddy has to be getting the easiest path they can give him. They gave the man Tony’s corpse. What’s sad is he still might lose. The push behind this guy from the UFC is obvious.

    Tony’s actually gonna get his ass kicked by that fat scouse prick.
  
    God this is gonna suck to watch.

    Im just hoping paddy talks enough shit to bring out the baseball holding, gloves, sunglasses inside, prom night shirt and vest combo wearing, and likely schizophrenic but always funny version of Tony at the presser
  
    Just one last time

    With the additional stipulation that the winner also leaves town.

    Tony is on a SIX fight losing streak, a rematch with Jared would have made more sense. Tony’s getting smoked
