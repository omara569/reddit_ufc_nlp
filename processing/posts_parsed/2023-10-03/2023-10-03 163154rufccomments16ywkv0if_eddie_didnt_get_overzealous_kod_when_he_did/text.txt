If Eddie didn't get overzealous & KO'd when he did + landed more leg kicks, could he have gassed Conor out late and won? we all know Conor has bad cardio, and Eddie has very good cardio. could he have beat Conor through 5 if he didn't get KO'd when he did, or would Conor have won anyway⁉️

    Where is the narrative of McGregor not having good cardio coming from?
  
    And to answer your question, no I don’t think so. On that night McGregor had Eddie’s number and was gonna finish him at some point anyway

    Lol Eddie has only won 2 fights since…and you couldn’t fit more “if-buts-and could haves” into your question?

    I see where your head is at but for the vast majority of these situations I think the result stays the same.
  
    Would Jose Aldo have won had he recovered enough from that left Conor threw to stay in it longer? Probably not he probably would’ve just got dinged with several more, he was still very hurt.
  
    Would Sean Strickland have beaten Alex if he recovered from that left hook? Probably not he probably would’ve just ate another later that round.
  
    Would Aljo have beaten Suga Sean if he survived those hammer goats on the ground and found a way back up? Probably not he was really hurt too.
  
    But idk it’s possible. We saw in Kongo vs Barry if you’re really rocked and can just survive then it’s possible.
