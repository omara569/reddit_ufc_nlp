lol at 6:30 he says Derrick Lewis faked the KO and just didn't wanna fight anymore while showing the KO shot ðŸ˜‚ yea man I'm sure an elbow to your face when the back of your head is against a metal pole won't KO you... what a clown

Maybe he should try be on the receiving end of an elbow from a 265 pound Samoan and then make that claim!
