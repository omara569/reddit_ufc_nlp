Haven't rewatched it, but going into the 5th, Reyes was coasting knowing he should be up and was about to win. As a neutral, I remembered thinking Jones needed a finish to win. "Close fights is not a robbery" but I felt Reyes was clearly up at least 3 rounds.How many other fights did Jones lose?

    The Gustafson and Santos fights get brought up often, but watching those ones back, most neutral parties would say Jones won (though they were both razor close.)
  
    The Reyes one really sticks out because, while the fight COULD’VE gone to Jones if you watch it with the right kind of eyes, it’s undeniable that Reyes was the better fighter that night. Yes, Jones COULD’VE won that fight 48-47, but his three rounds were all close, while Reyes undoubtedly had 2 rounds in the bag, and made all the other 3 quite close.
  
    What takes this all over the edge though is that one of the judges had the audacity to score it 49-46 for Jones, which… I don’t even know.

    To this day, I’m still upset for Reyes. Nothing has has been good for him since and then Jones vanished with the belt for 3 years

    Still cant believe jones got the decision over reyes, which first 3 rounds were close enough to go to jones? I had it reyes 1, 2 and 3 clear then he gassed and coasted round 4 and 5

    I think Jons won Gus 1 and Santos fight pretty clearly but I still dont understand how anyone could give Jon 3 rounds against Reyes, much less 4 like that dumbass judge

    I thought Gus won the razor close first fight. JJ got his ass beat that night.

    i thought reyes won the fight but not in any way by dominating fashion or anything. did think he took it though. also definitely thought gustafson beat jones as well. sorry ik i spelled that wrong. and another one i cant think of the guys name now all of a sudden was a very close fight with jones but was to close to call really.

    Reyes didn’t do enough. People need to get over this fight.
