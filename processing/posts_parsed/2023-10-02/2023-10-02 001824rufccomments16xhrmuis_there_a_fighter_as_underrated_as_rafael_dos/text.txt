is there a fighter as underrated as Rafael Dos Anjos? beat Robbie Lawler, Felder, Anthony Pettis, Donald Cerrone twice, finished Kevin Lee & Neil Magny + KO'd Benson Henderson. only person who was able to beat him in his prime was Khabib who was a monster, RDA is a legend, wish he got more respect.

RDA literally has a post about him every 2 or 3 days saying "Pre iv ban RDA is so under rated" so how is he not respected enough

He was 31 years old when he got KO'd by Eddie and then beat by Tony. He was still only 33 when Colby beat him. This guy just likes to set his own goalposts for his opinion on "prime" RDA because he's a big fan.

RDA was a beast though.

I've never seen a fighter more praised for losing than RDA.
