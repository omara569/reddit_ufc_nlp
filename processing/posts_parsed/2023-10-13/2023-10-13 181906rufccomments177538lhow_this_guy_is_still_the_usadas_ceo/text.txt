Anti-Doping Agencies are all farce. From USADA to VADA, nothing but a big facade.

USADA claiming integrity. When this is the same organisation which time & time again ruled Jon Jones test failures as non-intentional & him not being a drug cheat, lol. Pronouncing his test failures as stemming from contaminated supplement to picograms to what not

(not counting his UFC 182 test failure due to cocaine metabolite)

Honestly, everyone who was buying USADA's bullshit statement yesterday that they immediately walked back on was just blinded by Dana White hate. Dana also had nothing to do with this.

Hunter Campbell perfectly explained everything today. And if you're trying to tell me that USADA wouldn't have given McGregor an exception if the UFC asked in order to extend their contract, then IDK what to tell you.

The UFC is switching to a better testing company. Drug Free Sport. The same company that handles the NFL, MLB, NCAA, etc. USADA actually contracts them out all the time to collect samples for them.

I'm not an expert in scandals or swimming but that sounds sus af, dunno how he could have a position so high and for it to go on as long as it has, maybe UFC leaving USADA is the larger moral high ground here
