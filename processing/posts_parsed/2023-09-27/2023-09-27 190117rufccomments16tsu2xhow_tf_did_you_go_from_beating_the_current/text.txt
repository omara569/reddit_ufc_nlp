How tf did you go from beating the current champion then to beat #4 Marvin vettori to then weighing in as back up for title fight to then fighting #7?

    Thank you for speaking sense. This is his job and he's already spoken out about not making enough money. The man has a family to feed he's not gonna sit on the sidelines waiting for something big when he can make money now.

    He’s talked a lot about how he’s just trying to make as much money as possible. On paper this should be an easy win.

    Because jared doesnt have the luxury to sit and wait out, strickland will probably fight DDP then his next fight will probably be either izzy or khamzat (if he beats paulo) so their will be 3 people ahead of him or he can squash this chump and fight for the title after

    Cannonier has like 9 fans.
  
    Everyone likes him, but there's no excitement or desire to see him be champion. He's nearly 40 and had the ULTIMATE snoozefest in his one title fight opportunity.
  
    Great guy, never met em tho

    Hes trying to stay active by padding his record against an opponent who he doesn't believe to be a threat. While the championship picture clears up because he knows he doesn't have the best case for next shot.
