    I mean kind of loaded given he knows good and god damn well Dana will never allow a cross promotional fight to happen. I guarantee Chatri would eat up the opportunity if it presented itself

    Of course chatri would. Nothing to lose and everything to gain.
  
    UFC would be guilty of commercial retardation if they allowed this type of cross promotion without some big compensation

    Champions league style tournament would be pretty cool. Top guys from each promotion face off over the summer each year to prove who's the best of all organisations.

    UFC vs Bellator and Rizin vs One FC semifinals, winners then fight in the finals and get 5k and a plastic trophy
