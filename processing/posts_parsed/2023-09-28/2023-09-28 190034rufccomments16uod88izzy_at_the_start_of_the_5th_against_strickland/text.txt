This never made any sense. Does Izzy know if you die you lose? Probably sounded as good as ‘frozen like Elsa’ in his head.

He was ready to go to war to get a KO, even if he got KO’d himself from being reckless.

Unlike the pussy mentality vs Strickland where he had no confidence and ran the whole time.

How does it not make sense?
