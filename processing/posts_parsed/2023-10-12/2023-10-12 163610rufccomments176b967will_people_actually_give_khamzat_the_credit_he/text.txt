Will people actually give Khamzat the credit he deserves when he folds Marty in half in less than 4 minutes?

“Marty’s been done since 278,” “Prime Marty would’ve destroyed him,” “If they fought at 170lbs it’d be totally different,” etc, etc.

Will you still place your lips around Khamzats cock when he folds to Marty's pressure?

They better. I’m not going to let them retroactively turn Usman into a ‘washed up’ fighter like they try to do to everyone else who loses to someone they don’t like. This fight right here is between two elite fighters and the winner gets full credit.

They should. Usman may not be the elite of the elite anymore but he is still an elite fighter and it will be a much better win than Burns

Probably not. There’s so many Dagestani haters out here.

Khamzat is Chechen. He's best mates with Chechnya's dictator Kadyrov
