    Thatâ€™s the attitude to have. A true competitor. I hate this get to #3 and sit out until they get a shot. Yes I know wonderboy has nothing to lose but still.

    We don't deserve Wonderboy.

    There are holes in Shavkat's standup that WB sees but I don't think he is gonna be expecting the buzzsaw in front of him.
  
    He may have holes, but he'll just add another part of the game and shavkat has way more tools if he can get them going.

    I feel like it's what I saw with Mike Perry.  Especially on younger guys like these.
  
    Mind you Mike Perry is fucking tanking hits without any gloves in. And just keeps moving forward.
  
    Gonna be the same here. Some people can tank head kicks even. It's nuts. Wonderboy ain't got the power. I think shavckat will wear him down.

    If WB can beat Shavkhat then yes I can't even argue. Shavkhat is that dude... he looks so fucking unassuming  but he's a fucking killer

    Shavkat has plenty of years to get another title shot. Which he probably will.
  
    Wonderboy on the other hand is fighting his last few fights imo
  
    Wonderboy vs edwards is a dream matchup of mine. Plz mma gods! Plz!!!!

    WB might ruin Shavkats 100% finish rate, WB is super hard to finish.

    Geoff had some success on the feet. If wonderboy can stuff a couple takedowns he has a good chance against shavkhat
