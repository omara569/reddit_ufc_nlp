Usman is literally right below GSP when it comes to the best of WWs, what you mean finally getting respect? He was about to break Silva's win streak before he lost to Leon and you think people didn't respect him?ðŸ˜‚

Usman had a lot of hate during his title run he was even labeled as a boring fighter

No respect from the odd makers thats forsure

gamblers, not odds makers. Bookies have to stay neutral so more people are betting on Khamzat than Usman that's why the line is what it is, bookies don't give a flying fuck about respect lol
