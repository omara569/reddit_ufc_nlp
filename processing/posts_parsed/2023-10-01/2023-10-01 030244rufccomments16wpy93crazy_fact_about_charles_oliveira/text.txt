    That info doesn't seem right.   Without putting much thought into it, Robert Whittaker doest have a win over another undisputed champion.  Neither did Sean Sherk.  I could probably come up with more.

    Well, if Chandler, Poirier, or Gaethje had been good enough to beat Charles, they would have become the undisputed champion

    Yeah itâ€™s a silly stat. Cherry picked to discredit his career when he clearly has several elite wins

    Not considering Tony as undisputed champion only because the UFC was branding Conor, who never defended any belt, already trashes that silly argument.

    I mean Tony never was undisputed champion. You may not like it and neither do I but you can't just pretend like he was lol.

    So by your logic, Gaethje became undisputed champion after defeating Tony and Khabib was never champion until he beat Gaethje.
