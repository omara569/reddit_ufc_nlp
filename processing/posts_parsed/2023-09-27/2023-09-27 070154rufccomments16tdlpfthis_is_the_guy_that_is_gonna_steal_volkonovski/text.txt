    I don’t see Ilia beating Volk but if he does i’m 1000% blaming it on the cover curse lmao

    Why not? He can wrestle, he can strike, has power. You can't even see a flash ko in the realm of a possibility?

    If Ilia beats Volk, I'm likely gonna believe the curse. I didn't believe it when Izzy beat Costa when he was the cover of UFC 4

    The cover curse or the 35+ curse?

    Jokes aside Illia could really do it, he is a monster on the feet and on the ground.

    Cover curse aside, Topuria is an damn good fighter and skill wise, it's 50/50 if you ask me. Too many fans judge fights based on the names and resume, not actual skills and abilities. Topuria can do literally everything Volk can do, some things he even does better. And he's a decade younger and feels zero pressure and is full of confidence. You might call this stupid, but I don't think anyone else approached a Volk fight with this level of confidence and they all lost. Volk isn't just older than Topuria. He's gonna be 35 in 2 days. That's right on the border of the end of his prime. I still see Volk winning. But that doesn't change the fact that I am 99% sure Topuria will be champ one day. He's 26 years old, undefeated, and earned a fight with P4P Volk. This is a win-win for his career. Imagine how much experience a 26 year old can get. Imagine his potential AFTER fighting Volk, win or lose.

    Good thing the cover was Jared Gordon and not Volk. Looked absolutely nothing like him.

    Im gonna buck the reddit trend.  I think Volk absolutely MONSTERS Ilia.  Similar way to rhe last fight.  It looks close for a round, Volk gets ahead in the second, then his freakish endurance comes through and he just absolutely obliterates Ilia.
