Islam Makhachev's mindset after the opponent switch makes me feel that this may have been Olive's best chance, and now it's gone.

Both Islam and Volk have this intensely competitive attitude that is missing from so many fighters.

This. Omg, it's going to be another fucking masterclass from both sides. The first bout was already a firework of fight IQ but both Islam and Volk are fucking eager to settle the debate all for once, can't wait for 294 ðŸ”¥

And they arenâ€™t dickheads about it either, making them both universally likable

The 2 best fighters in the UFC and the real BMFs of the UFC. Charles blessed us by not wanting this fight

Heâ€™s basically saying Charles was a boring matchup because he knows how to nullify him. He wouldâ€™ve done Charles the same as he did last time

Olives best chance was still no chance, be glad we have a fight where we can wonder whatâ€™s gonna happen this time
