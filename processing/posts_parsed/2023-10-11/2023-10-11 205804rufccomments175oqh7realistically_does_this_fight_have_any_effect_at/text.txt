Realistically, does this fight have any effect at all for either man in terms of rankings and title aspirations ?

Usman vs Strickland 2 for the MW belt would be a crazy turn of Events

Usman not getting a title shot off this fight, heâ€™s got quite a few people he has to pass at 185 to get that

You'd be crazy to think a dominant win for khamzat wouldn't raise his stock high. Usman is no joke.

And if he handed Khamzat his first loss, that's very incredible.

Dana just confirmed the winner gets Strickland next. Hilarious btw.

Winner gets title shot

What, absolutely it does. If Chimaev beats Usman he is number one contender at 185 calling it now. And if Usman upsets Chimaev he can also take that claim. This basically is a number 1 contender match.

Du Plessis is literally right there, what has Chimaev or Usman done at middleweight to get a title shot over Dricus, a man who made light work of Robert Whittaker.
