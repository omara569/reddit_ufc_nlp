We all know that Dana hates Belal. He just isn't a draw. So the UFC could make it the main event of fight night or Belal could fight for the title on pay per view where the card is stacked with bigger fights. This is what happens with alot of women's mma title fights. What do you think they should do?If Belal fights for the Welterweight strap
