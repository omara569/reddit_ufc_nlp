Volk is the replacement. Confirmed by Dana.

    Volk is one bad motherfucker. Taking a rematch on 10 days notice against Islam is psychotic, and I mean that in the best and most complimentary way possible!

    Wow this is a risky fight for both Islam and Volk.
  
    I think Charles cost himself another shot at the title for awhile..

    This has all the upside for Volk, he‚Äôs a badass win or lose. Whilst for Islam‚Ä¶win and it‚Äôs not as touted since it was short notice. But in all honesty, Volk is still the scariest opponent short notice or full camp.

    Win-win for Volk. Lose-lose for Islam.

    Same but on this short notice? If Volk loses there will still be endless debates whether Volk would have won with a full training camp.
