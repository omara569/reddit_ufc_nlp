    Lol such a terrible example op.
  
    He had by any standard an absolute stellar career.
  
    Ronaldinho played for Barcelona, AC Milan, PSG & won 97 caps for Brazil & was a World Cup winner in 2002.
  
    Copied & pasted from his Wikipedia:
  
    Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, he won two FIFA World Player of the Year awards and a Ballon d'Or. He is the only player ever to have won a World Cup, a Copa América, a Confederations Cup, a Champions League, a Copa Libertadores and a Ballon d'Or.

    Ronaldinho in his prime was one of the best to ever do it. He won the world Cup, champions league, multiple titles, while having dribbling skills like I've never seen in my life. I'm not sure if there was an MMA fighter who was an unstoppable champ in his prime but didn't have much of a long career.

    Could make a case for McGregor actually.
  
    Exciting to watch. Achieved greatness. But still didn't reach his full potential because he didnt push himself in training and loves to party too much.

    This is the answer. Talent for days, short prime due to lack of discipline.
  
    People mentioning Anderson Silva must have some serious reading issues.
