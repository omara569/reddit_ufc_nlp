This sub in a nutshell

    This feels more like a triple-threat match, because I honestly feel like people are fans of all 3. How could you not be?
  
    But it's a big moment for Volk because no one saw him getting a rematch any time soon, and there's no guarantee he ever would have, depending on how fights shake out, so I get why folks are psyched for Volk.

    Most respect all 3 but most like a good underdog story, hence more support for Charles and Volk.

    Pauli’s pull out game is second to none. You don’t get that jacket and have that much heterosex with that many woman without a few kids running around if you don’t have good pull out Gane.

    As a volk and Charles fan I was pumped either way. Islam is improving with every fight so it’s going to be a hell of a fight
