In your opinion, if Stipe beats Jones, would this be a bigger upset than Strickland beating Adesanya?

    Stipe is the only guy to beat both Ngannou and DC. Stipe and Jones both are the only guys to have a W against DC. So its like they are almost at the same level. It’ll be shocking but Stipe aint no huge underdog like Strickland beating Izzy.

    Yeah and on top of that I think most people will agree that the best version of DC fought at heavyweight. Jones should win but I’ll definitely never count Stipe out against any man on the planet.

    Stipe is waaaay past his best and hasn't fought for 2 years after getting badly KO'D. But his legacy is in stone and I believe he is still a live dog in this. He's hard as a coffin nail, high level boxer and anti-wrestler. Stylistically, he's a match for Jones. Athletically? Maybe not.
  
    Strickland? I thought he wouldve been blasted out within 1 round.

    Nah because some people actually expect stipe to win. Literally NO ONE on planet earth expected Sean to win.

    Nope. Stipe is the HW GOAT, while Strickland was a nobody. Also, they are in the HW division, where every punch matter, so he ko'ing Jones wouldn't be that surprising
