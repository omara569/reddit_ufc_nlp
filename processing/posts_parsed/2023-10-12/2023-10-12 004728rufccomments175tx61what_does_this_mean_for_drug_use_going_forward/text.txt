    Sounds like the UFC wanted them to pull some strings for McNuggets and USADA wouldn’t bow down to Uncle Dana’s requests.

    If you read the full statement there is a section that says
  
    "The rules also allow USADA to keep someone in the testing pool longer before competing based on their declarations upon entry in the pool and testing results."
  
    My guess is the USADA wanted Conor to stay in the testing pool longer than the six months and the UFC said fuck that.

    People already kept on roiding themselves, chito already told it's 20k and you're good to go. There's no delusion to think most professional athletes are doping. It's likely they go to VADA or some other agency that will cater to Dana's needs
