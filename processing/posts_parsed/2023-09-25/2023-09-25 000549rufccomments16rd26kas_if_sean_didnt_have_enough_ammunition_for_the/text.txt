    This is how misinformation starts, the drink driving was 3 weeks before the fight.
  
    If anything that's more worrying, but the narrative of him having a drinking problem post-fight sounds too plausibile for people to look up facts.

    Damn, I didn't even know about this. Wonder why he was drinking less than a month out for a fight, let alone driving afterwards. Maybe Izzy is in a worse spot mentally than we even thought.

    Apparently Izzy was barely above the legal limit? Idk though, you manage to get pulled over you probably weren't driving like a genius.

    Yeah the BAC limit in NZ is very low compared to the US. .05% vs .08% BAC . Izzy had .087%
  
    He wouldn’t be getting hammered 3 weeks before the fight, probably had a wine or two with dinner and got caught at a routine checkpoint

    Apparently went through an RBT, I’m not sure what it’s called around the world but it’s basically a checkpoint

    Hes also very low body fat, shit prolly hit him harder than it would most people esp during camp.

    Izzy is still the most popular MW in the top 5... as soon as Izzy is ready to come back, he'll get an immediate title shot. Depends if he wants it or not though.. I could see him taking a fight at 205 just "for fun"
