    I thought Volk was a bad dude for jumping in short notice, but Usman is an absolute fuckin savage for this. The balls on that guy for taking a fight halfway around the world against one of the scariest contenders we‚Äôve seen in a long time . Regardless of the outcome, he will always have my respect

    And dumbasses were saying he was scared of Khamzat when he was still the champ at 170. Usman is the definition of a BMF

    If this was at welterweight and Usman had a full camp, I could honestly see him winning. But short notice and at middleweight? I‚Äôm picking Khamzat

    I‚Äôm leaning Khamzat as well.  I‚Äôm interested in seeing if he can steamroll Usman.  Even short notice, I think Usman is a hard guy to just run through

    Usman - this card went from really good to amazing. Will definitely be taking usman, haven‚Äôt seen a line but imagine he‚Äôll be slightly disrespected coming off 2 losses

    Its not even a matter of disrespect but more about how old Usman is, don't get me wrong i still think Usman should has a really good chance of winning but he's also right at that age where people atart dropping off hard.

    I think the lines will more so be in favor of Khamzat because of how short notice this fight is.
  
    Regardless, even the worst Usman we‚Äôve seen is a handful for anybody

    If Usman has been in camp recently, this is gonna be 10 times better than having Costa fight!
