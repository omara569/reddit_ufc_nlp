Why does everyone forget Jon basically popped before Gus 2 but they made what he popped for legal and told gus jon did nothing wrong?

    The UFC literally told the public he was on roids and that it was acceptable

    But also had to move the entire event from Vegas to Anaheim (?)(California, anyway) because the Nevada Commission wouldn’t allow it, but California would.

    Well they said there were still latent traces of that in his system and explained that it was "pulsing" or whatever the fuck.

    Over his career, jones has received some of the most favorable treatment I've ever seen an athlete get.
  
    Popped for roids twice, suspended for one year only. Contrast that with Nick Diaz, who got 5 years for weed. Or Dillashaw, who got two years AND title stripped for popping once. Jobber jones also claims tainted supplement which is hilariously sad.
  
    He also has a record for number of rule violations total AND on average per fight. They changed the rules because of his eye poke frequency. Really silly to view his wins over DC/Gus/Santos/Machida/many others as good wins when he would eye poke them, kick them in the groin, grab gloves, and grab the cage. He was also awarded a robbery decision over Dominick Reyes just in case you thought paddy was the first guy to get the judges on his side.
  
    Oh yeah and after 3 years absent and over a decade of dodging top hw contenders, he not only got an immediate title shot against NOT the champion, he has been over marketed as "the goat" (which he's not) to the point where it just feels like the UFC has a deepthroating fetish for him.
  
    Dana White Privilege is 100% real and jones has a lot of it.

    Don't forget the time he admitted to hiding from the Nevada State Athletic Commission under the ring for hours to avoid a drug test and received zero consequences from it.
