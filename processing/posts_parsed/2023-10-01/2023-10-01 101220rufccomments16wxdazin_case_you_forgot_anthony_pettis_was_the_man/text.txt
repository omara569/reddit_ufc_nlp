In case you forgot, Anthony Pettis was the man ðŸ©¸

    Not showing his submission of Benson in any Pettis highlight reel is criminal. Benson was ridiculously hard to submit and then Pettis catches him with an arm bar where he used one arm to fulcrum the other. Legendary submission IMO.

    Pettis was the ultimate boogeyman for Benson, itâ€™s a damn shame there wasnâ€™t a 3rd belt for him to snatch

    He also submitted Benson when Benson had gotten his black belt weeks before the fight.
  
    Pettis was only a blue belt at the time.

    Iâ€™ll never forget the kick off the cage on the title fight during the WEC days. Absolutely legendary

    Bro, this is r/ufc. Of course they forgot. Pettis has lost a fight, which means he sucks, was never good, never fought anyone good, and is a pussy.

    Pettis def was fun to watch. He had some room for improvement that would've really helped his stay at 155
