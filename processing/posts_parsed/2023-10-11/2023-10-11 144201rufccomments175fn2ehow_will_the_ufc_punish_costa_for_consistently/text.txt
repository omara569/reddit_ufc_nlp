How will the UFC punish costa for consistently ruining cards?

    If he pulls out he seriously needs to be cut from the UFC. 3 cancelled bouts in one year, last fight he BARELY beat the ghost of rockhold, came in super overweight against Vettori, drunk against Adesanya and has zero wins over current UFC fighters. Like what is the point

    Cut him, his main job for a long time has been to be a clown on social media anyway.

    The UFC ruined these cards. Costa never signed a contract for Rob or Ikram and never said he was going to fight them.

    They should do everything they can to keep him on UFC 294 and if he doesn't make it to the octagon they should cut this man.
  
    I swear I have been saying this for the last 6 months this man will try to jeopardize the fight 2-3 weeks before the fight

    I agree. You think Abu Dabi can pull strings to let him fight for khamzats sake?

    Dude barely fights once a year since 2017 and is more of a liability at this point.
