    I'm rooting for Volk with all my heart, but he had surgery recently and is coming in on short notice. Really hope Volk fights like in Rd5 in the last fight, but I see anclear 4-1/5-0 by Islam via holding him down and not doing damage.

    On 10/11 days notice I feel more comfortable picking Islam.
