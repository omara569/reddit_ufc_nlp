Volk is my favorite fighter and leading up to the first I had him winning. In this one i think its over 90% change he loose.        There are so many built in excuses:        He just had a hand surgery        He hasnt been mindfully bulking/dieting for a 155 bout.        He was set to face a striker at FW. Now the best grappler at LW.        He has a 10 Day notice        He will have jet lag        He will not be climated for Abu dabi        He wont benefit as much as Islam from the long rehydration Window        He will have to spend alot of those 10 Days for traveling, weight cut, and media.        (Conspiratorial) if they go to a close decision Abu dabi will give Islam the rub.        Islam has had a full training camp w/ khabib, preparing for a serious rematch in Charles, so he will be dialed in.        I guess my question is, long after the fact, will be just say that 'look, islam beat Volk twice, arguably the best FW ever, and that is impressive' regardless of the actual context of each fight? I mean ive seen alot of people add TJ dillashaw as a valid accolade to Aljo sterlings record, Even though TJ only had 1 arm and the whole thing was a farce.        Volk got alot of respect for his performance in the first bout, but I recon Islam will Either finish him or dominante him in this one, partly due to the reasons listed. And that will effectively close the chapter for Volks 2 divison aspirations due to his age.        Islam isnt many fights removed from staking his claim as the LW GOAT, and I do Wonder how the Volk bouts will be remembered. Dismissively, or - Purely based om name value and on-paper prestige, removed from the context?What will a win over Volk be Worth for Islams legacy?

    In the short term, volks delusional fanbase will throw as many temper tantrums as they can to dilute the win but in a few years it will just be another green box on Islam's record and all the excuses in the world will just fade away.

    All I know is that no matter what happens, dagestani haters will stay dagestani haters, Oliveira fans will remain diehard, Dana will underpay his employees, and r/UFC armchair fighters will have infinite shit takes on the match.

    If it's a close fight again Islam won't get any credit like last time, and it'll be even worse for him cuz "short notice". I think we see a different matchup this time around but Volk's gonna come with a game plan also (knowing Islam's grappling isn't an issue for him so he can focus on something else this time), maybe they both go for the finish this time.

    Im alittle concerned that volk will overlook the grappling. Khabib Said islam has to come home after the first fight and work on 'mistakes'. If they have come up with answers to craig jones' anti wrestling moves volk wont have any tools left to nullify the grappling.

    Sadly it will Be discredited AGAIN. He‚Äôs fighting the smaller guy/not full camp/less than 2 week notice/in islams backyard.   It‚Äôs a shame. Islam could be chasing greatness but instead we gota take a step backwards to entertain Volks second try at Getting the second belt.

    Volk taking on a lot of risk. If he loses his legacy is basically just a great fighter who wasn't as elite as we thought.

    You sound very stupid. Volk is beyond elite. Short notice lost against higher weight classes champ, who is also elite, does not make Volk 'just great'. His legacy and resume still the same.

    Idk but if people can claim Volk is üêê level for beating Max 3 times (arguably only twice) what does it mean if Islam beats Volk twice is where my head is at
