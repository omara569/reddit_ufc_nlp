I want Charles to win but how do you beat this? Islam looks like a unbeatable dark lord or warlock

    We all went into their first fight thinking that Charles had a massive striking advantage.. that was proven wrong. Charles hits hard enough to change the fight but I don't think he can consistently outbox him and he certainly can't outgrapple him. I don't see it

    The game is moving fast. Grasso was prepared for Schevchenko's signature, Strickland cracked Izzy's code, Volk already came close to doing it to Islam. The greats are never safe for too long at the top.
  
    Islam and Charles are for sure some of my personal favorites across all weight classes so I don't have much bias towards who wins, and your logic is  definitely sound, but that doesn't mean Charles and his team can't make adjustments and come up with something good. In the end I agree with you that Charles coming out on top is not likely, but the real possibility of that happening is one of the things that makes watching this sport great.
