Tyrone Woodley says he would only return to the UFC to “Beat the f*ck” out of Israel Adesanya

    Let’s not forget Tyron Woodley has failed to beat a single ass after releasing the smash hit, “I’ll beat yo ass”

    Or he would just stand with his back against the fence and get picked apart.

    I can practically hear his corner yelling "let your hands go!" while he most certainly does not let his hands go

    I was a fan of this guy and really rooted for him. I cheered for him when he beat Till. I then watched him get whooped in the most frustrating manner multiple times.
  
    Then he fought like he was scared to throw a punch after practically begging for a rematch with jake paul. Then my man got knocked out cold and the whole MMA community took an L for that one.
  
    Sorry woodley. Dont ever fight again. If you do, I aint tuning in.

    This clip is at 38:30. I thought maybe this clip cut some context off, but I still dont know what he’s trying to get at
  
    He also says he has a boxing and MMA fight lined up this year, but didnt say a name. Idk what’s going on anymore

    The only thing Tyrone Woodley beats is his meat.
