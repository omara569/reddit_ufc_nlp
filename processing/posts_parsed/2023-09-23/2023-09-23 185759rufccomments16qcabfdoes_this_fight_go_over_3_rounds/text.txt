Does this fight go over 3 rounds?

    I’d love to see it go all the way. Could be the fight of the year. But honestly my guess is that someone is gonna go out on a stretcher. They both have enough power to kill a regular human with one finger. However it goes, it’s gonna be a banger that will go down in ufc history.

    This is an incredible poster wow. I expect a more composed approch for both fighters in this fight than the bloody war we usually except. A finish can happen in late 4th round by knockout, and I see Jiří found it.

    I have no idea what to expect, Jiri's wild movement as his defense instead of keeping his hands up, how is he gonna react to Pereira's power? Alex is gonna land for sure cuz Jiri gets hit a lot due to his fighting style so let's see who KOs the other guy first.

    I followed poatan nearly his entire carreer, if jiri doesn't wrestle and uses his normal fighting style, his style is gonna get him slept real fast.

    I think Jiri is too hittable , dude usually pushes the pace and uses his chin to survive
  
    That strategy won't work with Pereira
