MMA fans when the fighter who lost doesn't apologize for everything they've ever done and say the winner was the better fighter in every possible way

    That’s uhhhh what happen. Not an excuse.
  
    Someone once told me I was making excuses for a fighter because I said he got out struck. Lol

    You should’ve said Strickland is the superior being

    I mean yeah clearly this is not an excuse it is just what happened. His game plan was nullified by great coaching and Sean’s unorthodox striking was something  he couldn’t figure out. I commend Izzy for accepting this.

    Izzy haters when Izzy gave props to Strickland but didn't do jumping jacks on his dick:

    Izzy haters are straight up the worst. Even less objective than McGregor dick swallowers or Khabib nut garglers.
  
    Dudes were on here just trashing him when he lost, saying he never knew how to fight and all this shit that did nothing more than deny props to Strickland for putting it all together and giving us a masterclass performance.
  
    Like, I get it, you hate the guy, but this is MMA not your legacy hometown team sport. You don't need to invest yourself in that way. Just watch the fights and make your picks based on who you think is gonna pay you out. You'll enjoy it a lot more that way.

    Izzy is way more classy in defeat than in victory but you got to respect the fact that he is ready to acknowledge when he messed up and give props to his opponent
