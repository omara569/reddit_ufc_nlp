Leaving the ‘Conor dickriding’ and ‘Conor hate train’ bullshit aside, McGregor returning is huge for he sport and nobody who is genuinely interested in MMA can honestly say that they wouldn’t want to see the absolute head on collision that the Chandler v McGregor first round would be. Interested to see how this narrative plays out with the level of hate Conor has taken on this sub and the fact that a lot of people had written off his comeback completely.Starting to wonder what everyone who’s been adamantly dumping on McGregor about never fighting again will say if he comes back and KO’s Chandler and actually makes a title run

    Let’s be honest there’s no title run with Conor it’s title shot with one win so more of a title walk

    Could he KO Chandler? Absolutely. Could he make another run for the belt? Possibly, given Dana's hard on for him. Could he actually win the belt? Most likely not.

    He has a far better chance to beat Charles than he does Islam. Charles gets rocked basically every fight when he fights strikers.

    Conor is a sniper on the feet and chandler is very hittable. Also surviving round 1 chandler is not an easy thing. Fight is a 50/50 toss up for me

    If Connor comes back successfully goes on a title run and knocks Islam tf out I have no idea how this sun would react. I personally don’t think it’d happen but punchers chance idk

    A guy with trash cardio that spent half a decade sailing around with high blood pressure and cocaine on steroids, breathing heavy just walking out with Ryan Garcia is going to train at high elevation?  We’ll be lucky if he makes it past the camp
