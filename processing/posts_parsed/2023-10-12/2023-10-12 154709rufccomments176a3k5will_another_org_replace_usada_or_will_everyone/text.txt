    The whole point of buying another company is synergy where possible to save money. As soon as the UFC bought WWE the USADA contract was toast. They'll work with the WWE Wellness program to expand and administer it in house.
  
    USADA got salty and went after the UFCs biggest star like a cartel

    They said the UFC is gonna keep using the same testing procedure they have now. They're just gonna cut the middleman which was USADA.
  
    I'd imagine the UFC cut a deal with the testing lab itself and bypassed the need to pay USADA.
