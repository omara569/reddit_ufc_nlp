This song is the reason that Usman left his prime.

Probably my all-time favorite KO. The shot of Usmans arm fully extended, Masvidal's head and body twisted to the right, and all the sweat, oil, and water flying off of Masvidal's body. Epic.

One thing I loved about Usman, he was so active as a champion.

Fighters should get activity bonuses (if they don't already. I have no idea).
