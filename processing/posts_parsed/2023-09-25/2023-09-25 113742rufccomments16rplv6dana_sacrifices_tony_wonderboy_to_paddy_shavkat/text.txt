    People are really underestimating Wonderboy imo. Shavkat didnt look that unbeatable in his last fight.

    Yeah, I can see a potential path to victory for Wonderboy.
  
    I can't see one for Ferguson though.
  
    That being said, I think Wonderboy has the harder fight booked.  I imagine Tony will get choked out 90 seconds into the first round, easy last check before retirement.

    Paddy is the easiest fight in Tony last 10 years

    100% it is but at this point in his career I could see him losing to jared gordon ðŸ˜­

    Wonderboy vs Shavkat? Wtf?
  
    Shavkat vs Usman makes way more sense, no?
