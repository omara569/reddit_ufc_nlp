    Everyone on the left side would smash that old man, he'll always be known for the guy who got his jaw broken by Marty usman and he'll never be championü§£ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è shouldn't have wasted his prime ducking opponents

    He was up on most scorecards in that fight too you just don't wanna give the man a shred of credit. He softened usman up for Leon

    How do people think its an insult to point out that Colby got his jaw broken and still won the next round thats a compliment if anything

    I dont like him but you have 2 former champions with decent reigns and a 52 fight vet. This aint a great picture

    These guys were all clearly past their prime when Colby fought them. Ruthless who beat Johnny Hendricks isn't the same one who fought Colby, same with all these other guys. I mean I am a fan of all 3 of these guys for what they've done but context is important af in mma.

    He literally ducks top contenders, why do people feel the need to defend him?

    This subreddit is pathetic when it comes to Colby. 90% of you are losers in this life and the next.

    Colby calls people nerds and virgins but ironically it's those same people who are his fanboys.
