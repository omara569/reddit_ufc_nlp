    Why is this guy the only one who stays live to talk about the card after the fact? After an exciting card I'm looking for videos of people talking about it and he's all I ever get.

    I'll say it every time this fat bitches face comes up...seeing his reaction to Charles getting sonned sums up all I need to know about this loser.  A man got dropped and then submitted straight away but according to this guy it was really boring.

    As much as people hate him theres no doubt he is knowledgeable about the sport and cares about itü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è hes definitely a prick but he loves the sport and does full card breakdowns starting from the first prelim to the main event
