    I imagine his knees making a "crunch" sound every time he takes a step...

    I hope Usman pulls it off. Big move for him to step up here

    he wasnâ€™t bad simply just gun shy cuz he was aware of leonâ€™s set ups and leon was able to improve his takedown defense so leon was able to outclass him

    Fuck I was hoping to make some money on chimaev ðŸ˜ž god damn I expected chimaev to be a favourite but that's a little extreme imo.

    Legit, wanted to see Costa roll in fight week at 230lbs and be like whatever, but this is pretty dope
