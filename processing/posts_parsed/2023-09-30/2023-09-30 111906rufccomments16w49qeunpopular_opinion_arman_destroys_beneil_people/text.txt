unpopular opinion: Arman destroys Beneil. people always talk about how Arman "lost" to Gamrot who lost to Beneil, but it was a robbery + Arman improved since then & gave Islam a very tough fight, and Islam is way better than Beneil. Tsarukyan destroys Dariush

Robbery just means you wanted one guy to win when it was a close fight.

And if you’d call his performance against Joaquim Silva an improvement since the Gamrot fight, you’re an idiot.

you shame him for the Joaquim performance as if Beneil wasnt on deaths door against Drakkar Klose lmfao

Lol at robbery, the fight was very close and could have gone either way. Calling a close and competitive fight a robbery is just silly

It’ll be a good fight but Arman is def better now.

Arman is not on current Islams level. He refused a rematch because he thought he couldnt win.

I agree he won the fight but hes gotta win against some good name before hes considered a contender

Arman would get smoked by beneil and arman gave islam a hard fight like 6 or 7 years ago Islam has improved way more than arman has

Beneil is boring asf and super sloppy, Tsarukyan beats him easily.

How is Beneil boring? Except for the Ferguson fight almost all his fights are bangers.
