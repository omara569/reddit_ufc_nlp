The UFC still considers Khamzat a WW, despite him moving up in 3 weeks

    He is undefeated at Welterweight, so tbf the title of the video is correct

    What exactly is the point youâ€™re trying to make? Those fights he fought at welterweight donâ€™t retroactively become middleweight fights after he moves up. Iâ€™m really puzzled as to what youâ€™re trying to say.

    He's still currently ranked 4th at welterweight and hasn't (at least publicly) confirmed that he is done at welterweight all together.

    He could still fight at WW after we donâ€™t know.
  
    He hasnâ€™t confirmed that heâ€™s moving up permanently

    And before someone says that he was undefeated in his WW run - yes, but does it matter if he ditches the weight class? Would you pick GSP as an example of an undefeated MW?
