    Whitaker said he would never sign to fight Costa again. At this point most of the middleweight roster probably feels the same.

    First Rockhold cancel was on Rockhold (back problem) if I remember.
  
    Almost all other cancelled bouts were shady stuff from the UFC, announcing fights before anything was signed.
  
    Basically he has a lot of "declined" bouts on his resume.
  
    The Khamzat one is a real canceled bout but unfortunately for Costa, because of his resume it looks really bad

    Have there been any other instances of the UFC promoting a fight only for one of the fighters to come out and say they hadn't even signed a contract?
