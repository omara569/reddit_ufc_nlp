Justin Gaethje breaks the punch machine. Khabib was right when he said Gaethje hits like a truck.

Crazy he sat Charles down 3 times within a single round and Charles still had the faculties to finish the fight

Absolutely. We've seen plenty of guys (izzy recently comes to mind) who get rocked in the first and seemingly never fully recover from it. Crazy how many times charles has managed to

I still want to see who hits the hardest between him, Conor and Chandler. Not an opinon just actual numbers and meaSurements.

Conor absolutely hits hard but I believe a lot of his ability to stun and KO his opponents comes from laser accuracy, placing a hard punch on exactly the right spot when it's open; like how Izzy KOed Pereira so violently with a punch that didn't look like much in real time.

I think Chandler is the physically strongest of the three by a large margin, but lacks a bit in translating that raw strength optimally when he punches. He tends to wing shots with less focus on clean technique and accuracy, more like a battering ram, or like a Dodge Hellcat spinning its tires at launch; some inefficiency in getting that strength to work for him.

Gaethje seems to have a high degree of accuracy considering how fast his punches are, and he also seems to have the right arm slot and technique more catered to his own leverages and motion to further maximize his punching power. He also seems to have a very good method of turning into his punches judging from the rotation of his torso; quick, snappy, and only as much as needed. If I had to bet, I'd say Gaethje is the one of the three you least want to be hit by.

Now, I'd place myself above all three of those guys because combined they're closing in on 100 professional fights and not a single mention of "seeing red" from any of them. I see red when I bang my shin on my coffee table, so I know what I'd do when the cage door shuts. (This is the only reason I'm not in the UFC)
