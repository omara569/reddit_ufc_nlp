Khabib must corner Islam. Islam has everything to lose now and nothing to gain.

    Seems like nothing to gain at the moment, but as history pans out, beating Volk twice in a row will look quite good. But yes Khabib gotta be there.

    If he wins, he will certainly gain respect of those who question his first win against Volk. If Volk wins this fight in Abu Dhabi on short notice, It will be massive for his legacy.
  
    Volk said: Beating islam is more important than winning Lighweight belt.

    Having Khabib in the corner isn’t some kind of magic recipe. I also think it kinda takes away from Islams incredible skills with all this talk about Khabib in his corner or not

    Seriously, Khabib is a veteran presence but he isn’t some magical being. Islam handled himself fine without Khabib

    Khabib is his best coach and cornerman. Those things make a difference.

    Khabib better corner Islam vs Volk!!!
  
    Biggest lose-lose situation for Islam.
  
    If he beats Volk, he beat a FW who stepped up on two weeks notice to fight Islam in his home town.
  
    If he loses to Volk, Islam loses years of progress, the legitimacy of his first win will be questioned, IV rumors will run amuck once again, his legacy will be tarnished and Ariel Helwani will cream in his pants non stop for an entire year.
  
    Khabib better corner Islam in this situation and maximize the chances of securing the W and putting this saga behind him.

    I disagree with you and OP.
  
    This isn't as big of a win-win for Volk as you think.
  
    Let's say Volk loses. Some people will say it was only 10 days. But if you look at the odds, he was the underdog last fight and will be this fight. If he loses again, a lot of people will be turned off from a 3rd fight. Essentially, this might be Volks' last attempt to be double champ, and the odds aren't in his favor at all.
  
    Whereas, if Islam wins, a lot of his fans (which are most people in this sub) will say he won twice against prob the soon to be GOAT of featherweight. AND Islam still has time to go up to fight welterweight. This seems more like an easy way for Islam to kill his Volk problem and move on to double champ aspirations.
