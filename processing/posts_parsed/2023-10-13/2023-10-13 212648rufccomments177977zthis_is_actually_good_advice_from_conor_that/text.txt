This is actually good advice from Conor. That would help Izzy a lot in a rematch+conor getting in his monthly callouts

    Man I don't know about yall but to me it be completely random sometimes who Conor decides to just all of a sudden be nice as fuck to, and then in the next breath start shit talking another completely random dude lmao

    Well he clearly has favorites. And they tend to be people no where near a weight class he competes in like Izzy, jones, gane. I doubt think he has a single nice thing to say about anyone in the lightweight divison maybe except paddy

    I think Izzy is under same management company or w/e as Conor - Paradigm

    Hes always supported Izzy, they are both managed by Paradigm Sports. Conor frequently congratulates and says good things about all of their athletes.

    Conor had to make sure he wasn't being too nice
  
    Volk's catching strays

    Conor planting the seed when Volk beats Islam next weekend. He wants to come back to lightweight and thinks Volk will be light work. Thereâ€™s a reason the man is p4p number one

    Volk is a way more complete fighter than Conor ever was

    Conor is just a unique individual. Bro just dissed Volk out of the blue after giving another man a complimentðŸ¤£
