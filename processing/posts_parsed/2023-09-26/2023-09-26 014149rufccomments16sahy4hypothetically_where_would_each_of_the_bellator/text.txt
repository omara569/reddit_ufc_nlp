Hypothetically, where would each of the Bellator champs ideally rank if they were in the UFC?

and i wish UFC could get Bellator roster over PFL cause UFC needs actual young talent now and PFL has no competition for them besides Francis, itll just be Bellator IN the PFL.

Bellator has some pretty great talent, Coker’s just not been a good promoter since Strikeforce so people don’t give a shit about them

- Cyborg would be WFW champ now that Nunes has gone

- Carmouche would be top 5 WFlW

- Bader would be top 7-10

- Nemkov would be top 5 for sure; behind Jiri and maybe Alex and Jan

- Eblen would be top 5 for sure; behind Izzy, Whittaker and DDP

- Amosov would be top 3; He likely beats Belal, Colby and Usman but more competitive against Leon and probably loses to Shavkat

- Usman is champ level imo. He won't fight Islam but has a real shot at beating every other LW. Only close fights are Oliveira and Volk

- Patricio would be top 10. He would have been behind Holloway and Volk before but his form has really dipped since he entered father time turf

- Sergio would be 7-10. He lost to Font pretty convincingly

Disagree on Sergio, he's leveled up a lot in recent years.

Eblen would be top 10 at best, the dude is an absolute can compared to anyone in the UFC top 5

Nemkov and Eblen top 10, but only because they're in shit divisions
