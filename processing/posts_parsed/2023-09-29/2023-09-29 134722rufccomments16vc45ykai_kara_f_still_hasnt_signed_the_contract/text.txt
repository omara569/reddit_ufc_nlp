Kai is solid but he does not match up well with Kape's boxing and speed as well as his underrated head kicks

Iâ€™m a Kape fan but when did the tides turn to Kai being unlikable???? He used to be so loved and heâ€™s pretty respectful unless Iâ€™m missing something

Some of the hate he's getting is cuz of his coach saying DDP ain't got it cuz he didn't fight Izzy injured, you gotta push through the injuries at the championship level he said. Then he pulls out his own fighter (Kai) out of a high profile fight so fans are understandably upset at the hypocrisy.

Ofc you shouldn't fight with a concussion or an injury like TJ who showed up with one shoulder, no one wants that.

Kape is a menace, Iâ€™m so locked in for his next fight
