I hate this sport so godamn much.
This'll be a fuckin banger too, and that makes me even angrier.

    I guess I can take my hopes for Charles and redistribute them to Volk. No point being angry about it now.

    Itâ€™s a shame this fight is done on short notice. How in shape is Volk and how is his hand after surgery. What an absolute gamer and man of his word being active.

    Lol still absolutely no props for Islam who is the champion and one who has everything to lose by fighting a guy with completely different style than CharlesðŸ˜‚

    I hope Olives still gets a shot after this. I have a feeling Dana will hold a grudge and not give it to him

    My theory is that if Volk wins, Dana will do Islam vs Charles II as a #1 Contender fight, with the winner facing Volk.
