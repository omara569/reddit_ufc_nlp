The rule is so silly imo

For every 3 good fights you gotta have 1 really shitty one. Also donâ€™t you just fight cause youâ€™re sure as fuck not getting a contract.

Most bullshit rule ever.

Also varies state by state IIRC

Definitely wasn't grounded. Didn't fall forward at all until taking the second legal knee. Should have been a tko or no contest. Why was there no review even?

I swear Grasso kneed Valentina when she tried to put her hand down to be considered grounded but the fight continued and the commentary called on it saying you need to be fully grounded for it to count not just posting with one hand...

Yeah valentina desperately tried to abuse that rule when she was in trouble by quickly swiping her finger tips on the canvas, but alexa said bam- knee to the face ðŸ¤£

I still want them to go to what one has and allow knees to the head on the ground. This weight bearing rule is insane.

Yep makes zero sense, just like the 12-6 elbow. Knees donâ€™t magically do more damage just because your hand is on the ground.

The whole point of the fight is to knock your opponent out, silly that you canâ€™t knee grounded opponents.
