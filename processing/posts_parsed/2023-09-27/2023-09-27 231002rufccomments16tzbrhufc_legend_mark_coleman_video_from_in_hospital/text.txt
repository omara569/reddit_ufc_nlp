Was that boxing match off the table before this? Also man itâ€™s crazy how much Mark looks like heâ€™s aged.

He was big on the booze his entire life.

He is sober now but has mentioned how addicted he was to alcohol.

Eh, he always looked kind of old and heâ€™s pushing 60 after a lifetime of getting the shit beat out of him by old school rules. I think he looks as expected. He also is still in the hospital after a medical procedure. Hope heâ€™s doing ok.

Super appreciated watching this man compete in the early UFCs years and beyond.  Heal up and take good care of yourself.

Getting old and years of steroids does a number on your body.
