    The bottom guy is absolutely right, everyone knows that the only things that work in a real fight are shadow clone jutsu and rasengan

    wrestling is the way humans fight actually not boxing you're not built to box cuz ur hands are breakable. wrestling is how you know who's stronger and more athletic without injuring he other human i read that somewhere

    Top guy is right and bottom guy is who heâ€™s talking about lol. Striking is great but if youâ€™ve got an Olympic wrestler in front of you I donâ€™t care how many black belts you haveâ€¦youâ€™re getting ragdolled. You have one chance to land a heavy shot as they close distance, if not then youâ€™re getting thrown and youâ€™re getting your face rearranged.
