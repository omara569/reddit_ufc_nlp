    Michelle Waterson was in there? I thought that was the ghost of her former self........
  
    Outside of that, i'm just kidding actually being a Waterson fan since watching her on Bully Beatdown.
  
    But i'm going to be objective here as much as possible and say she probably cried because she didn't perform the way she thought she could, let everyone including herself down, and is now on a 4 fight losing skid making her 1-6 in her last 7. Which pretty much signifies the end of her career in the UFC or anywhere else in her mind before anyone (Fans or UFC brass) comes to tell her.
  
    That this fight was really it, the last nail in the coffin, the no u-turn on the long road, the final hurrah without getting to retire her gloves in the octagon and leave great memories behind for her fans, friends and family.
  
    Something no one who is a fan or really likes Waterson wants to see and way less than she deserves IMO.
