Alex is 36 years of age I predict him to fight Jahamal hill then either go up or defend the belt one more time and leave the sport.        Sad he came to the sport so old we couldâ€™ve seen so much more for him in this sport of MMAWhatâ€™s next for this man if he wins at UFC 295

    Hill, winner of Walker vs Ankalaev, Izzy will probably try one last time to move up before retiring, so there are a lot of fun matchups at 205. I don't know if he's planning on retiring early if he keeps winning, this is some life changing money at the end of his career so he'll get as much as he can, even if he's not champ being an exciting fighter he can get some good money for main events. Everyone loves a heavy hitter

    Whenâ€™s Jamahal coming back though? What if heâ€™s off for a year? After Jiri he would probably fight winner of Ankalaev v Walker

    You think heâ€™s going to heavyweight?

    I doubt heâ€™ll go up to HW. Too many heavy hands up there. LHW is perfect for him. I think itâ€™s hilarious that Badr Hari thought he was a HW hahaha.

    One or two title defenses, comes back down to beat Izzy for MW, retire as the #2 of all time MW's Achilles heel.

    If he wins, Izzy should move up a division to get knocked out and have Alex settle the score once and for all. ðŸ˜…

    If he beats Jiri, then defends against Jamahal, is he HOF worthy?

    He's HOF worthy if he beats Jiri period

    Current HOF standards are horrible they let anybody in the HOF at this point. So why not Alex, Heâ€™s also ranked #25th best Brazilian fighter of all time on the fight pass so I donâ€™t see why not
