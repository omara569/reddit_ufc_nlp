    I feel nothing anymore. It's the only way to cope with a tony fight week. Tonys worst enemy is Tony

    Well start preparing.  It’s going to happen, and it won’t even be close.

    I feel like people say this every time Tony fights now. Time to hang it up

    I believe Tony should have retired a long time ago. But if he's gonna fight, this is a good one.
  
    It's not unwinnable, it's gonna get attention cause of paddy(although I don't get the hype).
  
    And paddy even if he wins isn't a knockout killer like gaethje or even like Bobby green

    Don't worry. Tony is gonna win, which is going to give his masochistic fans the false hope that he still has it, so he'll go on to fight 3 more times and get brutalized each time.
