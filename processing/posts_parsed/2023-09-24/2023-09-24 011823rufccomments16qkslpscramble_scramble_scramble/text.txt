    It was so fun to watch. For a striker, Fiziev‚Äôs amazing for always being active and not just settling in grappling exchanges

    Someone posted towards the end there you can see Gamrot lift his leg pretty high to try and get him down, I‚Äôm sure Rafael is a flexible guy but I wonder if that kind of led to his knee giving out a little later

    Possible. The way Gamrot was shooting into his legs and bringing Rafas leg up all the way probably strained his knee. Sucks for him man. Hope he gets better but I think his chance for the belt is done if he does actually have a bad ACL tear. If it‚Äôs just a sprain or partial tear, that‚Äôs easy to recover but a full tear, that‚Äôs a career killer for any athlete.

    You know a fighter is doing exceptionally well when Cruz says "goodness" or at least sounds moderately impressed. Cruz is a technician and for him to react like that aint a small deal.

    Gamrot has some of the most explosive wrestling in the UFC. People who call him boring just wanna see striking.
