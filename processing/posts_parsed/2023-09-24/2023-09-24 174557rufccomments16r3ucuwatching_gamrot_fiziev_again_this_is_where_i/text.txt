Watching Gamrot - Fiziev again, this is where I think Rafael initially hurt his left knee

    Yeah, could definitely see that tweeking something.

    If it was his ACL that tore, then I think you're right.

    Damn great catch, didn’t even think about that.

    We were denied great show early. But I've seen comments disrespecting Gamrot for moment of celebration after stoppage. This clip showes he did try to get takedown, and Fiziev while defending it hurt his knee. So it wasn't only just bad luck while doing kick after all.

    I really doubt it. His knee gave out from side to side torque not up and down pressure. It’s most likely a MCL tear IMO

    Probably both. My experience with ACL tears is that the MCL went with it. Both times were lateral movement.

    Ya, I thought he came down on that weird when watching live, but never thought about it again. The knees are becoming a big issue for the UFC.
