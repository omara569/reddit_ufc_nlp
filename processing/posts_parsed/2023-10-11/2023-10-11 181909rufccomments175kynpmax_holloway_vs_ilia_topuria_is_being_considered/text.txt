Max Holloway vs Ilia Topuria is being considered for UFC 297 on January 20th for the interim FW title if Volk can't make the date. (As per Ariel Helwani)

    Have you seen the life Max lives outside of his job? I'm not worried about him.

    Max will be fine. We have seen that Max fans are the ones who are actually malding when he loses

    If Max were to lose to Volk a 4th time, retirement or a move to LW are the only things that make sense. Anything else, what are we doing.

    I find it very weird how people don't think Ilia can be the one to break Max's unbreakable chin.

    Okay, nice fight. But why interim? The champ is there. I'm getting sick of these interim fights to justify the ESPN deal from the UFC. Bro, you're devaluing your titles like that.
  
    If the champion isn't out on injury or taking a massive break, there shouldn't be an interim fight. Period.

    Max Holloway fighting for a meaningless featherweight interim-belt in Toronto. Sounds familiar.
