Does anyone else dislike Colby but is hoping he wins just to see the redditors seethe?

    The thoughts and feelings of some random pricks on reddit don't factor into my hopes and dreams. They shouldn't for you either.

    No. Because we don't have the emotional maturity of a 14 year old

    Yeah, on reddit everybody is an edgy 16 year old. Completely different

    So... you'd prefer a division to wind up in the hands of the least active non-injured fighter in the entire UFC JUST to see some fools mad about it online? Are you even a fan of the sport?

    I am praying for Leon to win so that the UFC can FINALLY move past Colby and the division can stop being held up, because waiting on Colby (while he dealt with his fake brain injury that Masvidal allegedly caused) and forcing Leon on to take this fight has stalled the division. And every Colby fight is like pulling teeth to get him in the octagon. You'd swear he was the most popular or accomplished fighter in the sport.
  
    Fuck that, get him TF out of here, and let's get some real and deserving contenders in the mix.

    Shouldn't be rewarded for his inactivity and reluctancy to go against the competition at 170. Always ducking fighters, ducked Leon Edwards for years because he wasn't much of a name but had to beg him for a title shot in the end. If he gets the strap I can see him going on a long victory parade and refusing to get back in there and be an active champ

    Actually it seems pretty much the opposite. The other post with colby on it is full of people roasting him and his delusional fanbase, which doesn't really appear to exist on reddit.
