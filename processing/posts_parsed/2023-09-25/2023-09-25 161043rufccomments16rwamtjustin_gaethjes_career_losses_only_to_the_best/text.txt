    Why the eddie Alvarez hate? Hes definitely above poirier in the LW all time list, not taking anything away from poirier but of all 4 hes the lowest on the LW all time list

    I'm a fan of Eddie and the post is sorta bullshit but Dustin is better than him. If you wanna look at titles you can make a different argument but he's just more talented.
  
    Even just looking at the résumés, Eddie only won one title fight in the UFC. Fought 8 times and only won four, two of those being split decisions. Dustin's two title shot losses have been against the two best lightweights ever who Eddie never faced;  would've beat Eddie twice if not for the knee; beat Holloway who was favored 2-to-1;  stopped Eddie, McGregor twice, Pettis, Gaethje, and Chandler.

    Headkick, headbonk off canvas, sick backflip. Gotta love Gaethje, entertaining as hell win or lose. He was stoked to get that one back. I’m glad he’s won his last 2. Gonna miss that guy when he’s gone. A lot of great fighters retiring the past couple years

    Eddie Alvarez is one of the best to ever do it. The guy has held a title in nearly every promotion he has fought in.

    Idk why Eddie Alvarez gets so much hate, he put up so many crazy fights, became a champ in two different companies and had absolute bangers of fights.. then he lost to a prime connor and everybody acts like he is nobody lol

    People who hate on Eddie are clowns. One of the most credentialed LWs in history. Gave us never ending barnburners and beat some of the best. People only know him for the Conor fight, and never watched before or after that.
