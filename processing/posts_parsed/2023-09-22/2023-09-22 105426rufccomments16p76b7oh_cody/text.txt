    His athleticism is elite but decision making abilities sorely lacking.

    Codyâ€™s championship performance against Cruz was so fun to watch, and one of my favorite of all time. Then against TJ at 217, a win was in his grasp before he started spamming right hands and got caught. Even in this fight, he drops TJ and just goes into berserker mode. Shame itâ€™s been downhill since.

    Unreal how he canâ€™t avoid eating a fucking right hook.

    Unfortunately Cody seemed to always try to force big moments in his fights. If he could keep cool and calm like he did against Cruz he would have been champ a little longer or maybe for a good while.
