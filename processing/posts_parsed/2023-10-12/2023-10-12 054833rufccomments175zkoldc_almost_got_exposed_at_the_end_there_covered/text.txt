DC almost got exposed at the end there. Covered his ass and quickly ended the interview 🤣

    This seems like such an inside joke that they know that nobody buys the ppv 😂

    Lets be real.   The PPV market is on its last legs.
  
    That worked when nobody had good internet.
  
    I expect a major focus on advertising to be the future.

    In the OG russian link video it's actually DC's last training for his retirement fight, and that's why he's promoting the PPV. still Khabib wouldn't held onto his values of never pay brotha

    Khabib is an honourable man. He would never pay for PPV.

    I like Islam. He’s a funny dude. I don’t understand why people in here hate on him so hard.
