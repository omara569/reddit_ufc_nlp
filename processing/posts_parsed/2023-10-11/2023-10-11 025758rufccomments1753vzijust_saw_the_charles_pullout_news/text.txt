    The guy punching the monitor (Cash Nasty) plays 2k and is a huge Lebron fan, one of his biggest dream since starting his YT channel was to meet Lebron. The guy  on the screen (jesser) is also a 2k content creator and is a friend of Cash. On screen you see Jesser meeting Lebron, which infuriates Cash for some reason.

    Islam didn't get any credit last time, everyone talked about how impressive Volk was which he was but in the official rankings he was still above Islam lmao. I'd rather see Islam v Volk after a full camp so there are no excuses from either side. It's a big fight why rush it. Give Gamrot the shot or something.
