Remember leading up to Colby’s first fight with Usman when Dana hated Colby. Good times.

Colby fans when they shit on Masvidal but also realize they gotta hype him up because he was Colby’s last win: 🤯🤯

It’s so impressive Colby finessed a title shot. 3rd title match in his last 5 fights. Colby is so good at manipulating his career and the fans.
