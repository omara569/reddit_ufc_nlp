    Like him or not Conor vs Alvarez, completely dismantled the guy.
  
    Jones vs Shogun
  
    Cain vs Lesnar / JDS 2

    Woodley vs Till. Everyone thought Darren Till was going to DESTROY woodley, hell woodley was the underdog eventhough he had beaten robbie lawler, demian maia and stephen thomspon for the title. So for Till to not even score ONE strike on woodley in the two rounds the fight had lasted was a shock ! Imagine you bet on the favourite and he doesn't even land one strike.
  
    Prime woodley was different.

    Usman just full on foot on the pedal the whole fight and woodley couldn’t keep up

    Silva vs Sonnen 1.
  
    If there hadn’t been that misunderstanding about the rules in the fifth round, Chael was on his way to 50-43ing Anderson. Chael literally landed more strikes on Anderson in that fight than he’d been hit with in his entire UFC career combined to that point.

    Connor over Eddie. Easily.

    Conor over Alvarez for a multitude of reasons.
  
    He moved up a weight class
  
    Made Alvarez look like an amateur.
  
    Got the finish. I don’t think there has even been a better title performance
