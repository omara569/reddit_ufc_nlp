When light heavy was vacant they made like an iMediate fight twice with women no one gives a shit cause womenâ€™s bantamweight has no fans

Because the #1 contender of that division has quite possibly the worst boxing in the ufc men or woman

Dana himself said the division probably ends with Nunes retiring.. there arent even rankings for it

You're thinking of women's featherweight

Didn't nunez retire the belt. And therefore the division?

She retired the featherweight belt but not the bantamweight thatâ€™s why itâ€™s still on the website because otherwise big women could not fight in the ufc
