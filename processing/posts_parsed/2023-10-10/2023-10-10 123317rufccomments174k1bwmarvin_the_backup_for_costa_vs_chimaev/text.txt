    He has a grappling match for ADXC (Abu Dhabi extreme championship)
  
    Benson Henderson is also headlining the card

    Khamzat vs Costa is probably the most anticipated fight on the card and Khamzat is way too important for Abu Dhabi to not fight. Costa being injured, it makes sense.

    Marvin IS gonna pop for PED if he stays that close for too long with Gordon Ryan

    If you haven't, you gotta watch Vettori and Costa face time each other before their fight (Marvin is wearing is blue and red jacket). It's funny as hell

    Why is it that gordon looks like hes in his mid 40s to early 50s? There must be a reason for that

    Nvm Vettori. Wtf is Gordon Ryan taking? He had little to no muscles like three weeks ago. He's putting his body through crazy rituals. That's insane.

    If youâ€™re talking about that imagine from Twitter that was a while ago and he was very sick with bad lighting and no pump.
