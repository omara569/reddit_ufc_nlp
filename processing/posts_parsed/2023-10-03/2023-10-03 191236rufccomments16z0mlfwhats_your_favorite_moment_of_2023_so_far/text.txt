    As someone who started paying attention to Strickland about a year ago, that was definitely my favorite moment as well.

    When Sean Strickland truly showed the world that he wouldn't lose to a man that beats off to cartoons and paints his nails.

    Favorite fight was Islam vs Volk
  
    Favorite shot was O'Malley dropping Aljo
  
    Favorite moment is Glover saying "let's go baby" while the officials are deciding whether or not to stop the fight - heading into the last round of his MMA career, face absolutely beat to shit. Legendary fucking moment.
