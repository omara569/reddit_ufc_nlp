With those odds I am hammering a Usman/Volk parlay. Unlikely they both win but fuck it why not

I think Khamzat wins, but I’ll be damed if I don’t put up a cheeky 10 bucks for a Volk+Usman parlay

UFC feels like WWE now. Suddenly two Brazilian out and grin nowhere until the ring appears two new opponents.
