It makes no sense that Burns Vs Muhammad was a 5 rounder and Pereira Vs Jan wasn’t

Glad it was 3 rounds, 5 rounds would be awful since they both had zero gas left. Salt Lake City is a bitch for fighters.

Alex looked way fresher comparatively

Both said they would only fight if it was a 5 round fight.

Number of rounds in a  contender fight is not standardized and it comes down to negotiation/main event.

Now that you mention it they should def negotiate a higher pay for more rounds. Idk how it works. But more time more pay.

Not that the extra rounds would’ve been needed, but it really irked me that Oliveira vs Dariush wasn’t scheduled for 5 rounds either, especially considering it was a rescheduled fight that took place the month after Burns vs Muhammad. Especially considering that the latter fight was put together on short notice, with one fighter coming off a fight the month before, and the other coming off Ramadan.

Jan would get Kod if it was 5 rounds. But if it was 5 rounds then he wouldnt have used his gas tank to wrestle in early rounds

UFC needs to either stop having fights at elevation or fighters need to make more of an effort to train for it.  Jan really shit the bed in that fight. Idk what he was doing in prep, but it obviously wasn't enough.
