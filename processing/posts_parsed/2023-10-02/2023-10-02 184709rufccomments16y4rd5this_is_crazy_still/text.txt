    Can someone explain to me the benefit of doing push ups like a 4 years old?
  
    He barely dipped doing them?

    apparently its for serratus anterior/medial head of tricep, its supposed to be a skullover/Jm press style pushup where he can focus more on extension to work on punch lockout. I feel like doin a banded JM press or a tate press would be a better option, but it kinda works
