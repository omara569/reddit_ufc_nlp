    Explanation:
  
    Justin and Sean are both from Arizona
  
    Sean Brady vs Kelvin Is a rumored fight
  
    Rose wants to stay at flyweight (If I’m not mistaken I don’t really care about women fighters tbh)
  
    Benoit will prob beat Matt frevola and he deserves a big push so give him Dan hooker (The BMF himself)
  
    Volk will most likely fight in Perth for Ufc 298 and Sean also wants to fight early in the year so he will probably fight at UFC 299 leaving islam only available to fight on UFC 297
  
    Islam can’t fight at 299 or 300 because of Ramadan

    Never underestimate Gaethje’s ability to blow the big moment by way of submission. To think he stands a chance against Islam is just ridiculous.

    Yeah he keeps saying that islam isn’t khabib whilst he said the exact same thing about Charles.
  
    He said Charles wasn’t khabib and that he was very beatable then got destroyed.
  
    Well he does deserve the title shot

    Prediction for my own card builder
  
    Islam: 1st Round Sub
  
    Suga: Unanimous Dec
  
    Kelvin: 3rd Round TKO
  
    Rose: Boring decision
  
    Benoit Saint Denis: 1st round sub
