Unpopular opinion. Oliveira being out of UFC 294 works in his favor. He can negotiate a different venue next fight.

    If Volk manages to beat Islam, they are very likely going to have an immediate trilogy, or wait for Volk to fight Topuria at 145.
  
    I doubt the UFC would be keen to let Charles sit on the sidelines, and would likely make him fight someone like Tsarukyan or Gamrot

    He’s either gonna have to wait until they do the trilogy is Volk wins, after Gaethje if Islam wins, or fight Gamrot in the mean time. If he does fight Gamrot and win, he’d be undeniable for next available title fight

    Brazil is very shitty to host an event. Their fans are disrespectful and violent whose behavior affects those people who are innocent and friendly.

    Its a lose lose for him, he just spent ages on the camp and preparing. For all he knows the next venue could be in a worse place. its easy to Idealise that it would be easier in brazil but i don't think it would make any difference to Islam or his team, they literally asked to fight Charles in Brazil lol

    Venue doesn’t matter, if you’re a champ you should be ready to defend anywhere. Islam fought Volk in Australia.
  
    Islam will hopefully defend against Gaethje early next year and then rematch Charles in Abu Dhabi
  
    Nobody wants a PPV in Brazil after the shitshow last time

    I mean tbh i always thought charles could pull it off ether way it didn’t matter the venue but
  
    Charles should still be able to fight for the title its an unfortunate injury and would make sense for anyone to pull out with a cut like that so i hope he gets the winner of islam/volk 2.
  
    And for anyone who say islam would deserve a immediate rematch that would not be true at all.
