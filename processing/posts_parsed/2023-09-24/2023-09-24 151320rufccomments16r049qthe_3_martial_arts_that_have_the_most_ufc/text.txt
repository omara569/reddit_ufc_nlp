The 3 martial arts that have the most ufc champions

    That's just because most fighters are Americans with a wrestling background. There isn't much college BJJ or high school BJJ

    Wrestling is just a giant plus for a combat sports athlete. You can dictate when, where, and how the fight happens.
  
    High school wrestlers can go to BJJ gym and bully older blue belts/brown belts usually just by staying on top or in the guard rotating.
  
    Wrestlers also do well against people who don't even know what TDD is, and strikers have to deal with someone who wants to rush at them and take them down. It's harder to learn how to get up than it is to learn how to stay away.
  
    Not saying it's invincible, but they keep popping up for a reason. It's just difficult to beat and when they apply it well it's usually one sided. Everyone can punch.

    GSP never did wrestling but was a master wrestler. Silva and Aldo were both bjj champs but struck more than anything throughout their career. This is no way to compare martial arts

    in isolation, wrestling is the closest to a real fight compared to other sports. definitely the best base if you could only do one before starting mma

    I'd think boxing is closer to most real fights.  Especially in bars.
