Every single dude was a bad matchup before Khabib faught them.

Everyone was a bad matchup for Khabib after he retired too.

Im happy Islam dominated Oliviera so I dont have to see the same old "Khabib would have lost to [fighter of the week]" post every day

Everyody Khabib fought in his last several were bad matchups for him. Or that was the narrative. Justins wrestling. Schooners mythical striking etc. Same thing happened.

Absolutely, but still not as bad as Paddy though. Khabib would suffer a stroke during the press conference trying to understand a single word of Paddy's scouser gibberish.
