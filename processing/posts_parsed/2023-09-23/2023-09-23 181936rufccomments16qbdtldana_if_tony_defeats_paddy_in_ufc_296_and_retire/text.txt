Dana if Tony defeats Paddy in UFC 296 and retire into the sunset

    Don't gotta worry about that, because Tony isn't the "ride off into the sunset" kind of guy. If Tony wins, he stays around and gets smoked by someone else... and if Tony loses, the UFC will cut him because they've squeezed every drop out of him and gave one of their favored children a win with a name... Also, Paddy's star power and stock have dropped TREMENDOUSLY (the Gordon fight and how Paddy handled it, combined with the odd stuff he was saying really killed his star), and despite what the UFC thinks, and win over Tony won't relight that fire with fans.
  
    The only people who actually still like Paddy are in the UK/western Europe.
