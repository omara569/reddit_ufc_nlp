    Reem is still very cognitive. Hes not there to be a minister but basically a posterboy for his favourite party.
  
    Believe it or not here in croatia CroCop was in the parliament for a term. Very smart articulate guy.

    yay, Overeem can join the list of the great political minds like BJ Penn, Tito Ortiz, Jeff Monson and Herschel Walker, truly the politicians of all time
