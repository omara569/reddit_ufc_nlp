If Costa ultimately pulls out, who should we see this guy fight instead? And please a legit contender inside top 10, preferably inside top 7...

    Doubtful they'll get any of the top guys on less than 11 days notice.
  
    Dricus is likely getting a title shot next, so he'd be stupid to jeopardize that by taking a sort notice fight against an opponent as dangerous as Khamzat.
  
    Izzy just fought last month, so I can't imagine he'd be ready physically and mentally to jump in against Khamzat.
  
    Vettori has apparently already turned it down.
  
    Cannonier and Dolidze are scheduled to fight in December.
  
    Cannonier is already fighting down, so I don't think it makes sense to switch to another lower ranked opponent on short notice. He's better off sticking with the opponent he's been preparing for.
  
    As for Dolidze, he isn't going to give up his opportunity to fight a top 5 ranked opponent to fight on short notice.
  
    Brendan Allen is fighting Paul Craig in November. I don't think he'll risk his current 5 fight win streak for such a risky opponent who isn't currently ranked.
  
    Kelvin Gastelum is moving back down to welterweight and is scheduled to fight in December.
  
    The only ranked opponent available is Jack Hermansson, who hasn't fought since December 2022. I don't know what's going on with him, he pulled out of a fight with Brendan Allen earlier this year with injury and hasn't been booked to fight since.
  
    I'd imagine he wouldn't step in on short notice vs Khamzat either, considering they've already competed (in wrestling) and he lost 8-0. He'd probably want a full camp to fight Khamzat.
  
    I think making Khamzat vs Ikram Aliskerov 2 is the best idea. Ikrams original opponent pulled out and his replacement, Warlley Alves, is a welterweight coming off of 2 losses - I can't see that being competitive.

    Dolidze tweeted that he wanted the fight vs Khamzat fwiw

    Izzy or Cannonier
  
    Shavkat would be great too if he wanted that fight despite it being at MW
