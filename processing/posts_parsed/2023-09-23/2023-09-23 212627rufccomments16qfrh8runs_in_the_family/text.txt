    stupid rule, now if you're gassed out and can't find your rhythm, just throw a poke and you get 5 fucking minutes

    Make the offender drop and give burpies until opponent recovered.

    They need to start deducting points right away for this bullshit. If they did that, eyepoking would likely vanish overnight. Also some better gloves.

    Crazy how you can go from losing, to poking someoneâ€™s eye, to winning.. zero reason to not poke someoneâ€™s eye. Jake never recovered

    it should be automatic point deduction, idk how they can call it "not intentional" lmao what did you think was gonna happen when you tried pushing your fingers in your opponents face? ðŸ˜‚

    Unfortunate to see, he looked really good right up until the eye poke.

    This card is getting weird. Eye poke. Now blow to the back of the head that stops the fight.
