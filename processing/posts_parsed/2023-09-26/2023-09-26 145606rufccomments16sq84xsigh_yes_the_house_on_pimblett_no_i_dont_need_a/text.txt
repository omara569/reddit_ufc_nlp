    He is hilarious and controversial.  Some tune in for the controversy others tune in for the humor.  His fight analysis is pretty solid too.

    I watched this take in its entirety last night…Chael is smoking crack. No other explanation. He’s basically saying Tony beats Paddy based on Tony’s recent exit from the top 10 and Paddy having never been considered for it. He mentions Paddy’s issue with weight as well, but man, he’s looking at it all wrong IMO. Tony is on a severe downward trajectory and was in the top 10 only due to the caliber of opponents he was facing. He’s damaged. Bobby Green is no bum, but to submit Tony was unthinkable 3 years ago. I hope Tony beats him, but let’s be honest, this is a cyborg stuck in a decaying meat suit facing a young, hungry Paddy that desperately needs this win. Paddy is gonna finish him.

    UFC’s check cleared so chael has to continue the ufc propaganda.

    Even without Chael curse i would still bet on Paddy. Tony is washed beyond saving.

    The Chael curse seems to have faded as of late. If you want to see someone who’s picks are truly cursed, check out LucasTracyMMA on YouTube. He hasn’t gotten a pick right in ages.

    Pimblett most likely gets chinned once or twice but can recover whereas Ferg's ability to recover is gone, and will chin Ferguson harder and win.
  
    Unfortunately, Paddy will have a win over a legend on his record because said legend hasn't retired or been put out to pasture.
