    Always fun to read the comments on a Guru post.

    I don't even think Sean was ever gonna roast him in the post fight interview. He was just happy that he won and the fact that he apologised to Izzy after the fight suggests he wasn't focused on his dislike for Izzy in that moment.

    100% agree with him. Adesanya wouldve definitely done some cringey tik tok dance and talked mad shit about Strickland had he won.

    Couldn’t agree more. Can’t stand the dude and I’m not a fan of Izzy OR Sean, but he’s right here. Izzy got embarrassed in the fight, shriveled up when Sean called him out at the end and then gas lit him in to not talking shit at the press conference. We have the audio to prove it.

    Those that watch Izzy truly know that Izzy was going to do something stupid if he won.  I was expecting a dog pee on Sean's face if he got knocked out so fuck Izzy.  He can dish it out but certainly can't it take it.   Keep that hate coming.

    "stop crying like a bitch, you know what i do to bitches" is what israel meant to say to scare sean straight.

    Ever notice that people who hate Guru never argue his points ? They just say he’s a piece of shit or something like that
