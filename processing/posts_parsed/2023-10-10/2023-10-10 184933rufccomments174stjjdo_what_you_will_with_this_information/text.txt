    I’m rooting for Charles too but idk if their submission records indicate a grappling advantage; it just confirms the length of Charles’ career and the fact that he prefers to end fights by submission. Khabib in particular could’ve ended numerous fights by submission but he preferred to be more methodical in his positioning (submission attempts often risk surrendering the dominant position) and just beat the fuck out of people until they were softened up.

    This needs to be highlighted more. Im an Olivera fan but submissions aren’t grappling and there have been many incredible bjj people out there that just suck at grappling. Once it’s on the ground, that’s a different story but Olives is going to need the takedown first and that will be difficult.

    Yeah but you're forgetting that most important stat. Knocked out by the Flyweight Champion Islam: 1 Charles: 0

    Better add number 12 for Khabib & Islam once he’s done with Charles
