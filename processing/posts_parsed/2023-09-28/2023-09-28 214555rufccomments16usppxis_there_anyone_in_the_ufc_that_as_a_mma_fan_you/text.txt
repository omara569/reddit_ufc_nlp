Is there anyone in the UFC that as a MMA fan you want to like as they're undoubtably rather skillful in the cage but there's just something about them that really grinds your gears? Mine would be Mr Gary, who would yours be?

    Izzy and Jon Jones . Both are some of the best fighters of all time but they both have an absolutely shit personality.

    Belal. Every time I come around to liking him, I find him saying something stupid

    Izzy. He’s a good fighter, but always gotta do some cringe shit to ruin it.

    He speaks like a protagonist from a ps1 game, his dialogue is honestly terrible.

    I can’t stand Ian either, just a very disrespectful competitor… and extremely fake by his imitation of Conor

    100% like how he tried to turn people against magny as if magny goes home and starts throwing elbows from full mount on to his children when they don't clean their room was cringe as hell.

    Garry and Adesanya. I get that they're good but I don't like them.

    Sean O’Malley. Absolutely nothing wrong with him.
  
    But if you let a 14 year old boy design what he thought a ‘cool UFC guy’ would look like/fight like... it would be him.

    To be fair, that’s the market he’s going after and owning it. Smart to hit the untapped.

    Ian Gary’s fight with Neil Magny really drove me up the wall. He had his leg completely compromised and was on the edge of a finish. Neil Magny was not even checking the kicks and Ian just stands there. I was screaming at the TV “KICK HIS FUCKING LEG!” That could’ve been a highlight of his career but instead he head hunted for a knockout and drew out the fight. After all that Conor copy and paste stuff he said at the press conference I was finished with him. Feed him to Khamzat.
