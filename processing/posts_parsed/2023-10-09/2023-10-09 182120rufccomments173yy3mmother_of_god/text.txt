    Hey now, Derrick was able to push Roy Nelson's fat black belt ass off from on top of him, I kinda like his chances against a wrestler who should probably be a light heavyweight. I've been pretty wrong with my predictions here lately though so take it with a grain of salt

    Lewis could take this tbh Almeida has questionable stand up at best. He could also half ass it and tap within a minute ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è the duality of man
