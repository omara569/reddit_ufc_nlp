unpopular opinion: Eddie Alvarez has a more impressive win over RDA than Tony Ferguson does

Unpopular opinion. Eddie Alvarez is a legend and people need to respek his good name damnit.

Khabib beat RDA when RDA was on a 5 fight winstreak and after losing to Khabib RDA went on another 5 fight winstreak and became the champ. That's insane

I think that win is way better than Tony's or Eddie's to be honest. Not to mention Tony tickled RDA's brain during the fight, but his fans want to forget about that

Hold on I’m talking brother khabib ducked tony and purposely ate too much tiramisu on a Tuesday before the weight in because he knew he was gonna tap Tony’s shoulder

i'm an eddie fan, but i 100% agree. out of Tony, Alvarez & Khabib. Khabib has the most impressive win over Dos Anjos and it isnt remotely close

he dominated pre-iv ban rda, whereas tony and alvarez fought a depleted post-iv ban rda

Eddie Alvarez got a title shot after a 2-1 record in the UFC, with both of those wins being split decisions. Tony and Khabib were both on roughly 8 fight win streaks at that time. But Dana wanted Eddie as champ because he was the perfect opponent for Conor.

Eddie Alvarez winning a split decision vs former champion Anthony Pettis, vs Tony Ferguson winning a split decision vs journeyman Danny Castillo

RDA passed out before he even stepped into the cage with EDDDDIEE!!!  from a terrible weight cut, so it's less impressive to me than Tony salsa dancing mid fight

jesus christ man, when are you people gonna realise that RDA was depleted against BOTH Eddie & Tony, not just Eddie ffs

was RDA depleted as fuck against Eddie? yes

but the weight cut isnt what hurt RDA, it was the IV Ban, thats why RDA was depleted against Tony too. the IV Ban hurt him, exactly why he moved to 170 after the tony fight

both eddie and tony fought a depleted rda, not only eddie, pre-iv ban rda smokes both
