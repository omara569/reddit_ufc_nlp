We are all hard on Jon for his behavior, and how he can be either a good guy or out of control. Seems like mental health issues may run in his family. Maybe we should be concerned about him getting help.With Chandler Jones in for psychiatric help does this shed some light on Jon’s struggles?

    Right, but instead we just want to say how bad of a guy he is, and seems like he is a bad dude, but maybe he could be helped and on a path towards not being like he is.

    There is a lot of mental health issues in MMA, but we just want to say how bad a guy is. Dude obviously has issues. I’m just saying the UFC should over mental health counseling as a part of being a fighter.
