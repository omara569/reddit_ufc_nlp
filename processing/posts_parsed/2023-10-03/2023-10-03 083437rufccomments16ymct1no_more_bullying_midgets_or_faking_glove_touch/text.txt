    Paulo might actually be a midget if Holland is the cutoff

    Don't have sympathy for Holland lol, he told Wonderboy he wouldn't grapple in their fight and then started shooting takedowns after he started losing.
  
    Also you touch gloves before the fight to avoid this

    Itâ€™s called a jab feint and he routinely does it before shooting a takedown. Did the same thing vs Leechâ€¦Holland is just an idiot
