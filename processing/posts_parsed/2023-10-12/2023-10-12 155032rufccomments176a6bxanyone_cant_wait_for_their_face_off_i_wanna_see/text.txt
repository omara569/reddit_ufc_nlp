Anyone can't wait for their face off? I wanna see the energy they bring and most importantly their MW size.

    Khamzat is double the size of Marty and that 97% Td won’t work when Khamzat bodylocks him

    Martys being disrespected. The one time Khamzat faught a high level grappler he had the closest fight of his life.
  
    Usman is a former champ with 5 title defences with wins over Colby, Woodley and finished the guy Khamzat took to a close decision

    Gotta hand it to Usman. Former champ. Easily a top 3 WW ever (top 2 IMO). Taking up a fight against a beast like Khamzat on short notice as his first venture into a heavier weight class he’s never fight in. Insane.
