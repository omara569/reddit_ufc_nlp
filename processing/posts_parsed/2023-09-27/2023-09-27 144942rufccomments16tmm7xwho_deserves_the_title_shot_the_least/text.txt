One has actually been champion and is in the GOAT convo for his weight class... the other is the most overrated fighter in UFC history and likes fingers in his butt.

The reality is, he probably made a deal with Dana not to go hard at Jorge in court. Thatâ€™s why he has a title shot.

Why would Dana give a fuck about what happens with Jorge, especially now that he's retired?
