    I mean cmon itâ€™s pretty obvious the truck was in his ear telling him to take the mic away. Anyone who thinks it was his personal decision is stupid

    I've noticed a number of times over the years that these folks definitely have a voice instructing them through their ear piece, but I've never heard the term "truck" used in the context of those instructions. Can you explain what it is?

    Religion is like a dick. It's fine to have one, and it's fine to be proud of it, but don't whip it out in public and don't try to jam it down people's throats.
