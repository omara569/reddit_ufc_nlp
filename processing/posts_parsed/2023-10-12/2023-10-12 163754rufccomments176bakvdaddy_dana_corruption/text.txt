USADA has been far from perfect, they’ve needed to go for a while. This was simply the last straw, not the only straw. The UFC can find a much better solution to test these fighters. There are other companies out there who would love to earn all that money they paid USADA. Good riddance as far as I’m concerned.

They haven't been, but if you think in house testing is going to be a better answer...well, I got new for you.

We will all see in a few months. If Conor fights within 6 months, we know Dana doesn't give a shit about fighters.

We have seen it before with Brock.
