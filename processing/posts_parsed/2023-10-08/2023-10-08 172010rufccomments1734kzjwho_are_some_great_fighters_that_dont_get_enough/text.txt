Who are some great fighters that don't get enough attention?

    Carlos Condit, he fought insane fighters in UFC and has only been 'ko' once (out of 46 fights)  which was a knee injury against woodley, but man look at his resume..

    He was an elite striker. Had an insane chin and toughness but also great kickboxing and creativity with his flying knees, elbows etc.

    Matt Brown is a scary MF. Dude looks like he wants to kill every time he gets in the cage.

    Legit hard man before fighting too, his JRE podcast episode is like my favourite ever because he was basically coked up watching an MMA fight and because someone dropped out he literally just walked in the cage then won his first ever pro bout.

    I literally thought he killed Diego Sanchez with that elbow

    Watching him Vs Robbie Lawler might be the realest BMF match ever. There was a picture from that fight where Robbie had dropped Matt, and looked down at him like a monster, while Matt Brown looked up at him in pure uncertainty, Iâ€™ll see if I can find it.
  
    Edit: found it

    Matt Brown gets attention and respect for my view. People seem to praise him a lot for still fighting and winning in the way he is.
