    Cannonier
  


    Usman
  


    Strickland
  


    I don't want to see Strickland lose the belt because he took a last minute fight for the money and had no time to prepare for a very dangerous fighter.

    Sean Strickland is a 185er and is always ready to fight, but him being champ the UFC wouldnâ€™t like it, Usman would be the most hype but I think Jared Cannonier would be the most competitive.

    Plus, with how much stuff Sean has been saying lately on the conflicts in the Middle East, there's no way the UFC is flying him in there lol
