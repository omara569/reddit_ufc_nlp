If Tony can’t beat Paddy, he should be released from his UFC Contract. He has no more business being in that cage

    I am so sad I missed Tony’s prime. Well. His first prime, not the current one.

    I’ve never wanted anybody to win a fight as much as I want Tony to win this one.

    That’s what’s going to make this so much sadder than even the Diaz fight

    For his own safety the UFC should not release him. They should just stop offering him fights. If they release him he will fight elsewhere and that could potentially be worse (bareknuckle boxing).

    Tony should’ve retired two fights ago. But, what if Paddy can’t get past Tony? What happens to him?
