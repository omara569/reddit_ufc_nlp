Joe casually showing one of the goats how to kick
Iâ€™m aware of Joeâ€™s Taekwondo experience but itâ€™s crazy to see the difference in power and technique he has compared to GSP

    After this, the guy in red became the UFC Welterweight champ, and one of the greatest fighters of all time

    There's a really nice anecdote of Joe and Danaher, in which Danaher asked him if he knew anybody that could teach GSP that kick, in hopes for Joe to say himself.

    i think it's because joe has adopted a lot of the muay thai kick techniques without even realising it, the kick he did isn't really a taekwondo style kick. He raises his hip early to get his knee inline with his hip similar to a side teep, his heel comes up for a split second and then shoots back into his heel. Joe has shorter legs and is built more for kicking, where GSP has a 42 inch leg reach and his kicks always been kinda shit. I think it just mostly has to do with practise, its obvious that Joe has put tonnes of hours perfect it, where GSP would need to do ten times that to catch up

    To me it looked like a taekwondo kick ngl but I donâ€™t know much tbh. What I know is the power on those kicks is nuts. Can you imagine taking that in the rib cage? No thanks lol

    TKD/karate schools teach things differently depending where you go.
  
    Theyâ€™re not all the same, some actually train for power and not just flashy kicks. That chamber he does before kicking is classic TKD.
  
    And GSP had nice kicks, his leg kicks were money.

    when i was younger I went to the jae hun kim taekwondo institute, the same one Joe Rogan went to. I can say with confidence that is exactly how they teach the turning side kick. Not that everyone could do it of course.
  
    Also from stories I heard on joe rogans podcast, he would practice his kicks for hours on end everyday and even got into a fight with one of the instructors one time because he wanted to close the school for the night and rogan didnt want to leave.
