Anyone else feel like the average UFC fan has gone back to this?

He was tracked down recently. He’s an accountant now and stopped watching UFC because he says it’s no longer violent enough for him.

I'd bet this guy's already saved the universe and we don't even know it, like some alien invaders scoping shit out have already seen this clip and been like wait, if that's the people in the stands just watching their pro fighters... we got no fuckin chance

I'd say ufc fans have never been more educated then they are today.

Its just that some people like action based, stand up fights.

In any other sport it would be fine to say you like attacking play but for some reason there's an elitism in mma and those people get looked down on

There’s elitism in every niche. Everyone wants to feel special for their interest. You can be republican but someone else is much more republican than you because if XYZ. You can ride a motorcyclist but you’re not a real motorcyclist until you XYZ. Sure you’re a chef at a restaurant, but you’re not a real chef because of XYZ. Oh, you like MMA? Do you know who don frye is? You probably only like standing fights and dont enjoy the subtle genius of wrestling/bjj.

Dont take anything too seriously and enjoy yourself.

Yeah nerds are fans now

Going by this sub (not necessarily a good guide) it mostly seems to be former WWE nerds and messy drama boys who see the sport as a masculine version of the Real Housewives universe.

It’s so weird too. People here talk about fighters like they  know how their mind works or what they’re thinking because they follow their social media. Fucking weird.
