    Just to point out, having Khamzat on the satan squad would be really disrespectful as he is a practicing Muslim like khabib. Outside of the UFC he‚Äôs a good guy

    wouldn't really say wandy or Ilia are evil, to be fair Wanderlei has actually done a lot ofgood (helped out with numerous charities/womens shelters, actively helps up and coming MMA fighters financially/moral support, promotes healthy living etc) same with Ilia.
  
    DC is probably more evil, He actually cheated/intentionally fouled a bunch of times which Ilia or Wanderlei never did.
