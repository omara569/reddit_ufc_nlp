Maybe if Edgar didn't fight with his skull skin glued in place he might have won against Jose...?

Ali is a fucking tool bag. I’ll respect the people he represents but this man is a cancer and they should find new management.

of course Ali wants to make twice the money from two fighters he manages. This sleazeball cro magnon needs to stop tweeting nonsense.

Charles’ cut is much much worse in my humble opinion. If you sneezed on Charles he would open up. Charles is an idiot for sparring that hard so close to the biggest fight of his life. The winner of UFC 294 fights Charles next 100%, Do Bronx deserves it.

Edit: Ali should steal the McGregor fight from Chandler. Gaethje Vs. McGregor sounds so much better than Chandler vs McGregor

Credit Ali for being loyal to his clients but he’s such a sleezeball I’d never sign with him

Ally will sell you out to get a better deal for one of his upper end clients
