    If tony gets cut I could see him trying to sign with bellator or the PFL, he should have called it quits after the chandler knockout hes just adding fuel to a forest fire at this point

    I say this with all love for Tony. CSO 🚀 🌙 🥊 💎
  
    I feel like the timeline we are in has destined Tony for BKF and I don’t look forward to it.

    it's hard to stop fighting when Dana's given you 400k+ for your last 5+ fights.  Tony is over here eating punches and stacking dollars

    He's making dollars but not making any cents

    Tony should’ve never fought past the Chandler fight. I hope he can make a good showing against Paddy but I think it’s gonna be a short, fucked up night for him. Also, Tony doesn’t strike me as the kind of guy to just walk away. My money says he tries to fight again and he’ll get cut for his own good

    Fuck it was just like yesterday when I thought Tony was unbeatable. 12 W streak

    Tony the type of guy to want to have a 12 fight win streak, then a 12 fight losing streak

    They should sign CM Punk again for one fight against Tony so he can go out on a win

    This is the UFC retiring Tony - this is such an odd match making?
