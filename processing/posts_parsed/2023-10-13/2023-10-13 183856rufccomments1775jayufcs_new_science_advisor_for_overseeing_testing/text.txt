UFC's new science advisor for overseeing testing and results is the same guy who cleared Jon Jones during Picograms controversy, lol

Novitzky also added that Dr. Daniel Eichner will become the new science advisor overseeing testing and results.

Anti-Doping Agencies are all farce. From USADA to VADA, nothing but a big facade.

USADA claiming integrity. When this is the same organisation which time & time again ruled Jon Jones test failures as non-intentional & him not being a drug cheat, lol. Pronouncing his test failures as stemming from contaminated supplement to picograms to what not.

(not counting his UFC 182 test failure due to cocaine metabolite)
