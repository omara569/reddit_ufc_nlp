I think UFC is letting this happen because of the 6 losestreak of Tony, no way they would let this happen if Tony was still smashing people.Will this be Tony's redemption?

    I hope so I would love to see him get a win here. But Paddy should be the substantial favorite.

    A win over Paddy isnt exactly redemption considering Ferguson was belt tier once upon a time, wich paddy will never be. But, watching Paddy lose would give me a boner. His last "win" was fcking rtarded

    I mean, Tony's gotten a knockdown on chandler and green, and rocked gaethje with that uppercut. He still definitely hits hard. Paddys high guard is garbage, I'm praying to the MMA gods that he knocks this scouser POS out.

    Tony is a name brand guy and Dana is using that last drop of fight to prop Paddy up.
  
    That‚Äôs what this really is. I hope Tony shocks me but, win or lose, I hope he hangs the gloves up after this fight.
