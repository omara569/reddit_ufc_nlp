Is this BS? I know about Charles, but is Paulo out too? Who would make a good last minute replacement for Chen Chen? ðŸ¤”

    Where are those Brazil v Russia side by side posts for UFC 294? The Brazilians aren't even showing up bro ðŸ˜­
  
    Yes Charles is out and Costa is not gonna be medically cleared to fight, his elbow still has stitches and will not heal in time. UFC will not knowingly let a one armed fighter fight like TJ v Aljo.

    Marty Fake Newsman's arm!? I can dig it. Nah seriously, if that's what they are doing, I think I will actually buy this card now.  They somehow will have lost both the main and co. event...and somehow made it even better.
