People are mistaken about the USADA news. UFC wouldn't risk its stature by bringing in steroids. Also Conor would have 0 advantage if every fighter starting using roids, he will just be beat even harder and faster. Also theres WADA or ITA which runs anti-doping in the Olympics could work with UFC

They're still going to test, but it will be a different testing company.

Or if you wanted to go real tinfoil hat they allow mcgregor to use steroids and nobody else so that he can have an advantage it's just a theroy and I'm not saying I believe it but when there is that much money to be made Men will do anything to obtain it

Itâ€™s entirely possible they implement a new regime where if you have a freak injury you can take PED to recover fully. Look at Natty Weidmans last fight for example

Or they just use the same system that wwe uses as they claim to test their wrasslers

It wasn't about having an advantage it was just about being able to come back and make money sooner than later
