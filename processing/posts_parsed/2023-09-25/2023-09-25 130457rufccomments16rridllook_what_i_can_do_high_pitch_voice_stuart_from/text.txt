    Man, I hope Tony wrecks this kid and rides off into the sunset. I guarantee you Pimbletts heart is beating because he knows what an opportunity this is for him, knows he's fighting an aging lion and he's gonna try to come out and kill him. I hope Tony is really ready for this and takes him seriously.
