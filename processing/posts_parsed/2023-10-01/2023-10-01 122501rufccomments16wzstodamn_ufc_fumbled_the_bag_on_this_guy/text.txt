    No other way to say it. If they want to stay at the top, there going to have to start handing out real contracts to the hot prospects that clearly have a future. Offering them 12 and 12 to start, or an offer to come in DWCS should just be saved for the regional guys they use to even out the roster.

    When one of the biggest football stars in France comes to your fight, you know that UFC fumbled the bag big time
  
    Refusing to pay one of the most accomplished kickboxers in history becuase he wanted at least 100k/100k, but Dana was like 20/20, take it or leave it

    Iirc He was getting paid 40/40 from the org he was champ at and Dana offered 20/20. I think dana offered the same contract as the org he was champ at to set up a last minute fight on the ufc Paris gane/tuivasa card. But when that fight fell thru because of the commission he went back to his old ways.

    I think new, top prospects deciding to sign with other promotions is one of the best things that could possibly happen

    Strange fumble from the ufc since Cedric has the skill + personality combo many fighters lack and aren’t the ufc desperately trying to find the next big thing in MMA? Pretty dumb decision here lol

    I didn’t even see what happened. These edits are getting worse and worse. What happened to the guy that added anime shit on to clips?
