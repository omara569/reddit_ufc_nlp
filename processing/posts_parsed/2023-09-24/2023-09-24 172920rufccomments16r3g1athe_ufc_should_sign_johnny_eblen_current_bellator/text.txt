The UFC should sign Johnny Eblen (Current Bellator champ) and put him up against a top 5'er for a title elimator. He could even move down for the Leon Edwards grudge match.

    Didn’t realize he was 6’3” fighting at 185lbs.
  
    Just watching the clip of his win they looked like welterweights or less.

    He’s contracted to Bellator. You can’t just sign him.

    Bellator is going out of business. PFL decided not to buy it and it hemorrhages money every event they do. It’s why 299 had like 21 fights lol So pretty much all of the top guys are going to get signed to ONE, PFL and UFC. I imagine the UFC will make a play for him and a few others, especially Vadim Nemkov.

    Not gonna lie I think Cannonier would be a sick matchup. Both guys that trudge forward and will take one to give one. Jared has good takedown defense and is a dangerous dude in the clinch, I think he could get a late round KO with how unbelievable his cardio is.
