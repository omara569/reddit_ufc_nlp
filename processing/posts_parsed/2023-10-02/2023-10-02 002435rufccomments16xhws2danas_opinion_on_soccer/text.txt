It proves that non American people get real offended if you don‚Äôt like soccer. Sorry, football.

He‚Äôs right, god soccer is stupid. 90 mins plus secret extra time to watch a 0-0 fucking tie. Most entertaining part is watching another guy roll around on the floor pretending he got shot only to spring up 10 seconds later once nothing gets called.

God mma is stupid. 25 minutes and no one gets finished? Most entertaining part is someone pretending to get kicked in the balls to buy some time to rest.

See how stupid it sounds?

Yes, attaching blades to your feet and moving on ice infinitely increases the difficulty. Hockey players can run on a field. Soccer players couldn't even stand on ice.

When even basic mobility requires an insane learning curve you're at a talent disadvantage.

Add the amount of co-ordination and dexterity required to not just skate at speeds that dwarf anything resembling a soccer run but you have to avoid devastating violence while handling a small object on a slippery surface, and even if you find a little bit of ice to get a shot off the proportion of available net space to the object to score in a net with a goalie who covers 95% of it is insane. Sure a hockey shot is faster at 100 mph but that makes it even more difficult for a goalie to process and track.

Most peoples eyes who are new to the sport can't even follow the puck it moves so fast which requires higher order and faster thinking/reactions.

Meanwhile, you have to keep yourselves entertained in soccer when the same 3 players pass the ball to each other incredibly slowly for 3 minutes to advance 5 yards.

Now after all that you still have to learn how to skate backwards. Good luck with that.

I did my best to avoid bringing up the toughness difference but somewhere along the way I realized I don't need to. Its not even close.

Why are you comparing ice hockey to football when field hockey already exists.

In any case, why are you comparing two completely different sports?
