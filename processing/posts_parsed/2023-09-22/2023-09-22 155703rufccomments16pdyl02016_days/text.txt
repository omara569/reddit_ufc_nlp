Let's stop pretending like Colby will be some kind of golden "Active Champion". He'll cherry pick every opponent he faces. Y'all need to get off his dick.

    I love it, getting your 3rd title fight in 5 fights. That’s a straight up gangster move. Could anyone else manipulate his career that well? Even Conor’s last 5 fights haven’t been title fights he is only 2/5. That’s very very impressive work by Colby. Got to respect the hustle.
