Fighters from other organisations that could beat current UFC champions?

DJ could beat Pantoja.

Eblen could maybe beat Strickland, but I doubt it

Iâ€™m not sure about DJ. Overall he may be the better fighter, but he hasnâ€™t actually made and competed at 125lbs in years. Flyweight in ONE is 135lbs due to their weight cutting system, and itâ€™s up for debate whether or not DJâ€™s opponents in ONE measure up to the level of opponent he could be fighting at either 125/135 in the UFC right now. This all disregarding just how much of a madman Pantoja himself is.

I think Nemkov beats Jiri in a rematch, O Malley vs Mix would be very interesting too

I dunno, Jiri took Nemkov's soul when they fought, that's a hard call.

Bader would beat Jon jones if they fought again

Bader wouldnâ€™t crank top 10 ðŸ˜‚
