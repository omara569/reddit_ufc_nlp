This has quickly become one of my favorite MMA photos of all time
I know she got whooped and barely made it into the second round, but Michelle Waterson-Gomez looked more like The Axe Murderer than the Karate Hottie when she was telling the doctors to let her fight.

    Looks cool and would be a good promo image, just ignore her getting absolutely destroyed.

    Show this to your grandkids without any context and tell them it’s Joanna they won’t know the difference

    I thought she was about to let the inner dog out. Hearing her cry after the stoppage was heartbreaking

    I was hoping for a miracle comeback, felt great watching her tell the doctor to keep it going, felt awful watching her cry in the cage, felt a little better watching her smile and wave to the camera in Fiziev’s hospital video.

    Rodriguez really ate her fucking ass all up in this fight, it was hard to watch at times.

    I have no idea how the ref didn't stop this. The most brutal one sided ass whooping I've seen in a long time. Letting her get out of the first round like that and then stopping the fight 30 seconds in the second to have the Dr examine the cut? Then you got Cruz sucking the ref off on the mic. While I enjoy a good war this really just felt like the epitome of "if she dies, she dies ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"

    Especially considering that’s after a win. Michelle’s is after getting made to look like she didn’t belong in there.
