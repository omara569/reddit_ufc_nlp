Do y’all really think nowadays GSP could of beat Usman, Colby, Khamzat, Edwards, Burns, Shavkat, Woodley, Thompson… ? I dont think in today’s era he would of been as dominant as Usman

    He's an equal, if not, better wrestler than Usman with far better striking. He would absolutely compete with today's welterweights.  He was far ahead of his time as far as being a complete mixed martial artist.

    Yes. For sure. Gsp is one of the most complete martial artists we've ever seen in the ufc

    GSP was an anomaly. Put him in any era and he’s gonna compete. I truly believe yes, he would beat 90% of the guys mentioned. Woodley, Thompson, Burns, Colby, Usman, Edwards, Shavkat. We haven’t seen enough of Khamzat imo. But I only think Edwards gives him trouble out of these guys, but GSPs wrestling was so good because he combined it with almost a karate blitz timing. You can be the better wrestler technically and GSP is still gonna time that double and put you on your ass.

    Yall acting like this guy didn't have to get through an amazing wrestler Matt Hughes. The casual takes are at an all time high this past week. I need a break from this sub
  
    People also seem to forget that unlike usman GSP was able to avenge his losses. I know he beat leon on the come up but the fact remains he couldn't beat him again after losing

    He would’ve been just as good. Instead of coming up during the Stone Age of MMA training, he would’ve come up with the same training facilities as this crop. Plus, power wrestling and athleticism will take you a long way in any age.

    Man you never know. I honestly still believe that Usman is the best welterweight out there. He’d beaten Edwards before and was outclassing him in the second match but there’s a Nigerian curse that once a guy knocks you out they just fight stiff afterwards for a time. I honestly think he’s still the better fighter and it’s not a match up thing, I think he beats Edwards on all accounts… maybe it was the idea of retiring that made him fight sloppy in the third fight but God knows. Anyway, all that being said GSP vs Usman is the match up that tickles my mental pickle and honestly prime GSP would’ve given Khamzat more so than Shavkat trouble and GSP was always a true welterweight who scrapped with weight cutters. I think GSP holds his own in the division even now.

    Usmans knees are absolutely shot and he’s getting up there in age. Don’t expect him to win many if any more ufc fights.

    nah gsp himself said the newer generations are just better. the thing about gsp is he was so good he could be a very big threat to a lot of the top 10 ww today. i think he loses to edwards khamzat and shavkat but he beats kamaru cause he's a bigger better colby with crispier striking beats burns fairly easily struggles but beats woodley and he'll just boringly wrestlefuck thompson and i think he beats colby
