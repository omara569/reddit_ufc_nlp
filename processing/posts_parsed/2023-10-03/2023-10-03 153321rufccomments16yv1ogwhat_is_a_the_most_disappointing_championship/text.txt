What is a The most disappointing Championship Reign in your eyes

    I’m surprised no one has said Rockhold. Defeated an undefeated champion, was the total package, and appeared to be the future of the middleweight division. Then lost to an old replacement fighter he had already beaten in his first defense.

    Damn, you're right. I remember thinking he'd be like a modern Anderson Silva. He had cool techniques like questionmark kick, sick BJJ, a nightmare mount, and training out of AKA. One arm choking Bisping, goddamn... What a shame

    Idk how anyone could say anything other than Conor. Dude got double champ and was stripped of both titles for inactivity. What could be more disappointing than that?

    It could be argued that Rose lost her second title due to inactivity as well.

    Lyoto Machida very flaccid title reign. All I can hear is joe Rogan saying “WELCOME TO THE MACHIDA ERA” before a limp dick dec win into getting trounced by shogun.

    Shogun’s reign was very disappointing for me. He was the youngest PRIDE grand prix winner, a very entertaining fighter, but suffered a bad injury in PRIDE and was doing badly in the UFC because of it. He was slow and his gas tank was terrible. He actually gassed out against an old Mark Coleman. Thankfully, Coleman gassed out as well.
  
    He was my favourite fighter and I think at that point I didn’t think he’d ever be top 5 again. His first fight against Machida which he lost through judge robbery absolutely shocked me. I couldn’t believe my eyes. I wouldn’t have guessed in a million years that he would do that to Machida. The rematch comes along and he absolutely destroys Machida. I thought we had entered a Shogun era. That’s what I was expecting. We all know what actually happened next, though. Can’t really blame Shogun for losing to what we would later realise is the all-time GOAT. Was still quite disappointed we didn’t get to see a Shogun reign, though.
