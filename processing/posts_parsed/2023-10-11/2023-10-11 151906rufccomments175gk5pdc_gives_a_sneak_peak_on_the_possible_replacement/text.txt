DC gives a sneak peak on the possible replacement for Paulo Costa. Who is he hinting towards?

    That would be massive. If Usman agrees to 185.

    People thinking Izzy are nuts. He took a lot of damage a month ago. Nobody recovers that quick. If his team is worth their weight in salt, they wouldn't even take the call.

    Why does he look like he's on a train to the front line in 1943.

    The way he's talking it's gotta be Izzy or Usman, can't imagine either of those guys taking it on short notice, too much risk, especially for Izzy.
