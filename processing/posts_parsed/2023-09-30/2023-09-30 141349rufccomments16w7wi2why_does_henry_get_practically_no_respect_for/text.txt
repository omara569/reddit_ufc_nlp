Why does Henry get practically no respect for coming back and taking the champ at the time to a split decision (where he won the fifth round) after a three year layoff

    Only the winners are remembered in the end.
  
    Unless youâ€™re Tony Ferguson.

    Itâ€™s a largely forgettable fight thatâ€™s why
  
    Everyone acknowledges Henryâ€™s greatness but he doesnâ€™t have a big fanbase.
  
    Also how did Derek Clearly give Aljo the fifth round? Itâ€™s almost as bad as the 10-8 given in the Grasso Valentina fight.

    What gets me is the text message he sent to Aljo breaking down Oâ€™Malley were spot on. Heâ€™ll be a great coach.

    Because he retired in his prime, kept talking soo much shit, acted goofy, and lost.

    This is the point, he beat Marlon moraes which aged poorly as moraes just kept losing after then fought dim Cruz coming a dominating loss and an almost 4 year layoff then retired when the division started getting really interesting, then came back and lost a largely uneventful fight where he didnâ€™t do muchâ€¦â€¦how are we supposed to give him extra praise

    Eh I donâ€™t think itâ€™s surprising, he was never a fan favorite so he would have had to either win or at least put on a banger of a fight for people to really notice, he lost and it was a close but mostly forgettable fight so nothing ended up changing.
