    He’s such an inspiration taking on Dustin after he just got brutally KO’d.

    If this guy wins - going to trigger a bunch more of his haters… If he loses… we don’t talk about him for another 18 months until his next fight… for the belt AGAIN

    If he wins it would be annoying cause I know damn well that mfer ain’t defending against Shavkat, Belal, Gilbert, etc - it’s going to be the most dead division of all time

    If he wins he will milk that champ shit for as long as he can without actually fighting. And then there will be an interim belt.

    he literally tried suing Jorge for brain damage because he got jumped after 50-44’ing his ass.
  
    his lawyers told him not to fight because it will hurt his lawsuit.
  
    his lawsuit was dropped in exchange for a title shot
  
    why aren’t people getting this?

    He'll bring his belt to jail instead when he visits his boy. Jk Colby ain't beating Leon.

    After what Leon did to Usman in the last fight, I dont think Colby will win at all. Colbys striking is worse than Usmans and I can see Leon cracking him often. If Leon can use that same TD defense he used in the 2nd Usman fight, Colby has nothing for him but cardio.
