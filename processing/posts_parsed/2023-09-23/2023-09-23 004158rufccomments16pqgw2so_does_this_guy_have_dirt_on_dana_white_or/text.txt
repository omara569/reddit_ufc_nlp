So does this guy have dirt on Dana White or something? His only shown PPV sold as many as the intrerim fight between Ferguson and Gaethje, has no wins against anyone in the top 15 his style is boring and he has the same amount of followers as Shavkat.

    The reason why this man is fighting for the belt is because he generates engagement. He is not fighting until mid December and it has legit been every other post on this sub. If you don’t want him to fight for the title then stop talking about him.
  
    The mini meltdown this sub has had is exactly what the UFC wanted. If you want “deserving” people to fight for the title, talk about them.

    We weren’t talking about him, and Dana gave him the fight anyway. Now we’re talking about him.
  
    People who deserve the fight shouldn’t have to be discussed because it’s obvious Belal is the guy.
