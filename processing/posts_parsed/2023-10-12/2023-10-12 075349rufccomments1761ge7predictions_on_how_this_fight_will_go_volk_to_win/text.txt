Predictions on how this fight will go? Volk to win via TKO is my guess.

    If Islams cardio issue wasnt weight cut related then Volk by decision or late submission. Volk wont be hesitant this time.

    islam by submission 2nd or 3rd volk won't be big or strong enough and he was training for yair and ilia two guys who fight differently than islam

    Volk did say that if he were to rematch islam he wouldn’t bulk up the way he did in the first fight because he felt he overestimated Islam’s strength and the increased speed would be more of an asset than the strength he would get from a bulk

    Islam wins by submission. Maybe volk will win if he gets a lucky ko.

    Islam might knock him out this time. Just have a funny feeling.
  
    Volk is getting up there for a smaller athlete who’s been as active as he’s been, and his incredible performance last time along with his insane success over the past few years might have him slightly more confident than he should be. He also hasn’t had a proper camp, Islam has. He won’t have the element of surprise this time either, Islam knows what he’s in for — and as great a striker as Volk is, he is prone to getting dropped here and there.
  
    Idk.

    Islam wins 99% of the times in these circumstances. It isn't gonna be close. Like at all. He is getting finished in the 2nd or 3rd.
  
    Tf is he gonna do in 11 days? And then a surgery on top of that? He doesn't have time to prepare. Even if Islam wasn't training for Volk, he was still training for Charles. He's gonna have a lot of success on the ground.

    Islam will win by sub because volk is coming off his couch and recently had surgery. Cutting probably 10-15lbs in 11 days plus media and flying out to abu Dhabi

    I wonder how much his surgery is going to be a problem. Operation in late July with 6 weeks recovery. That means he’d start back in the gym around early-mid September (just a few weeks ago).

    All I know is that he was literally in my town last week eating big dinners at the local restaurants so that might help him with getting to the 155 mark 😂
