if this guy finishes wonderboy he deserves the title shot more than burns

    Why would burns deserve a title shot after losing to belal and khamzat in 2 of his last 4 fights?

    Belal was crazy to think he could just sit around and be the next for the title with possibly both Shavkat and Garry fighting at UFC 296.
