Not a Bad Fight, But Weird That It’s Top of the Seach
What do you guys get when you type in “Ufc” in the search on the fight pass app? First thing is for me is always a that catch weight fight between Lamas and Olives.        Not a bad fight. Olives came in at 155 for a 145lb fight, but lamas still got the choke in the second round. Just weird that it comes before everything else the UFC has to offer.        This the same for everybody, or does anyone get something bigger for their first result?
