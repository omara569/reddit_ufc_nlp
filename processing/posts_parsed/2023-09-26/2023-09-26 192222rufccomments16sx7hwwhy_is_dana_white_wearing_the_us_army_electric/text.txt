    Just when I think you guys can't get dumber I see this post about a Nike hoody with squiggly lines that vaguely look like a strawberry with a lightning bolt inside it.
  
    Can you guys at least have fun with your sillyness and create a 20 minute video about Dana being in the Freemason's or something?

    Very assuming and ignorant comment. That’s the same exact unit patch I wore when I was Army airborne up in Alaska. Wondering why he’s wearing it. Hence the term “electric strawberry“ instead of “squiggly lines”… Do they have some kind of deal training the army? Did they send another guy like Ted stickle up there to train them BJJ? Are they opening a new Arena there? I would love to go see a flight in Alaska…
  
    Good assumptions though. Perfectly on par with the average UFC fan.

    Perfect I knew it was about the 25 ID! Thank you. I finally got my answer. Some of these answers I got here and in the army sub are hilarious. The assumptions they make not knowing anything about the “electric strawberry”. Didn’t realize 25 ID was also in Hawaii. Learned that today.
