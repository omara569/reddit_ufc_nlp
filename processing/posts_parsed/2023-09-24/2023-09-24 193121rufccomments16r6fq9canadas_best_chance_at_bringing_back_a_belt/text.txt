    Canada can just buy Izzy and make him a Canadian Chinese Champion.  Triple C.

    Why is Canada so outdone by NZ and Aus when it comes to MMA. We got tons of gyms, plus a bigger population then both those countries put together.

    Canada's top athletes usually go for more lucrative sports like hockey and basketball. Australia/NZ don't have as easy a path to make it to those lucrative sports leagues.

    MMA events in some Canadian provinces were banned for a while and a lot of the big promotions folded as a result. A lot of the big gyms in Canada stopped putting out great prospects too (Tristar, Adrenaline, Xtreme Couture etc.). GSP, Rory, Stout, Hominick etc. all came up and fell off around the same time and then a new generation never really came to replace them from Canada unfortunately.

    all the Cannuckians are fairly decent. but i would love to see more activity out of them. i dont knkw how much they get taxed outside the country but UFC needs more events inside Canada. would love to see Hakeem Dowadu vs Charles Jourdain headline a fight night. would be the first time canadians headlined a card (i think anyways)
