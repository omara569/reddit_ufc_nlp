    Pretty sure The ufc will cut him after this fight.but tony will probably sign with bare knuckles or something else.i  wish him the best but the guy is really mentally ill and needs help from family and friends

    Bare knuckle tony would be a menace he’d be juiced to the gills and peeled out of his tree and pissed that the ufc cut him lol

    I think we’re all wishing and hoping for this fight, but if we’re honest with ourselves it doesn’t look promising.
