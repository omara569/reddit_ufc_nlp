Am I the only one bummed out about this? Something just doesn’t feel right. This technical masterclass deserves full camps on both sides — not to be a last minute replacement.

    Volka Full camp: $$$

    Volk had ZERO to lose. Its a huge pay-day with a win-win scenario. If he loses than it is perfectly understandable to blame part of it to being a late replacement and not having a full camp. If he wins than thats even better.

    volk 1000 percent has something to lose… he has a real chance at beating islam w/ a full camp.. now if he loses he’s not getting that 3rd shot… ufc does this way more then they should and it sucks..
