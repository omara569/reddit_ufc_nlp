Here's UFC Champion Volk trying to submit a basketball player bigger than him.. maybe Bradley Martyn was right

... he subbed him in a minute... and then didn't even start standing, nor was striking or violence allowed... low IQ post

And Jamal Murray is bigger and more athletic than Martyn I'm fairly sure. Too lazy to Google it, though.

If you've ever watched anyone roll at a high level, you'd be able to recognize when the more experienced practitioner is taking it easy and allowing the rookie to make mistakes, problem solve, and learn.

Volk could have subbed him much faster. But the more important argument in the Bradley Martyn argument is that people who say size difference would allow him to just pick up the smaller fighter and slam them into concrete.

Did it look like at any point Murray could have just stood up and slammed Volk? No. Volk understands leverage and how to wrap his legs to keep position. You can't just brute force your way out of things like that unless the smaller fighter has no understanding of leverage.

Now add in the part where Volk starts standing, blasts him in the knee with a leg kick, shoots a TD, and elbows his face open. Bradley wasnâ€™t right.

If you actually think that, then your opinion on anything combat sports related is now void.

Volk was barely trying ðŸ˜­ zero physicality in this video

To be fair Volk wasn't going near full force, and it looks like the rules were sub by chokes only.  Doubt a defending NBA champ would risk any type of joint damage from submissions.

Imagine a universe where he heel hooks Jamal's surgically repaired leg and says some wild shit like "GO HEAT!!!" Lmao
