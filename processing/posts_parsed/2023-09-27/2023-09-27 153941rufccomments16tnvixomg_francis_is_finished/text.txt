Francis literally only stands a punchers chance.

Heâ€™s got a chance and a big part of that chance is his punch

He's probably going slow to perfect the technique. Like they always say, if you can't do it slowly, you can't perfect it when it's fast.

Agreed. When he fights his hands are faster than in most training footage Iâ€™ve seen

I assume everyone is talking shit because he looks too slow? Well this is pad training, you're suppose to hit slow to get used to the movement ðŸ™„

Itâ€™s almost like the majority of people who browse these types of subreddits are not actually involved in the training or sport

Lets be real all this training will be for nothing, after a few punches from Fury hes going to lose all the fundamentals he trained and will probably fight like an mma fighter.

Shit will get serious when Ngannou goes for a double leg

Tbh his striking rarely even looks good in the context of an MMA fight. He looked good in the stipe and blaydes rematches. And credit where it's due, he often manages to land the big punch but he's wild and careless most of the time.
