    Making a statement about a new opponwnt is talking a lot? What else has he been saying?

    Before Charles pulled out he said Charles is a quitter maybe Iâ€™m late but I have never heard Islam talking this much trash before a fight

    He's right tho, I don't want either guy making excuses. Volk's not the type to make excuses but his camp on the other hand... (Dan Hooker, Criag Jones and Eugene with the IV accusations while presenting no evidence)

    Also his fans cling onto the "Volk is FW sized and almost beat the LW ðŸ¤´" while ignoring they were like a few lbs apart on fight night/Volk is a huge FW who's fought at LW before.

    Barehead didn't even commit to Dan's accusations. Eugene just said "something [with Islam's rehydration]  was definitely off but we can't say exactly what", which is interpreted to mean " I think Islam cheated but don't want to risk my reputation with a specific allegation, but I'll make a vague accusation that can't be disproved, and I think I sound comparatively professional next to that egg Hooker screaming about IVs on Twitter, aye"

    Heâ€™s right though. People will definitely make the â€˜short noticeâ€™ excuse for Volk if he loses.
  
    Canâ€™t wait for Dan Hooker to make IV allegations again

    Never has anyone fought 3 P4P top three fighters consecutively. Islam making history.

    Still won't be P4P #1 after he beats Volk again since Jon is fighting soon/they want him being #1 going into the Stipe fight.

    Knowing what I know about both fighters, this seems more like a message for fans than for Volk. Heâ€™s getting out in front of the chatter by pointing it out and trying to make Volk respond.
  
    But Islam knows Volk would never actually bust that excuse out himself, because thatâ€™s just not him. He has too much class and also the respect for Islam and the sport to undermine the result with such a dumb excuse.
  
    But you know fans would pull it out if he didnâ€™t. I mean,  we have already had plenty of discussion here about the short notice.
