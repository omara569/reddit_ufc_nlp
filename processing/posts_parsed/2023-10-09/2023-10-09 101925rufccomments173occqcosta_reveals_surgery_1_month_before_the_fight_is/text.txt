Costa reveals surgery 1 month before the fight, is this an early excuse? ü§Ø

    It's not an excuse, these things happen quite more often than you think, it's actually huge luck for the fans if there is a mega fight and both of the fighters had a good camp without injuries or any lines of coke

    I was gonna say OP needs to gtfo thinking this is an excuse. Surgery that close to a fight would typically mean the fight is off. The fact that he‚Äôs even competing that close out after surgery is kinda insane

    Jesus. Bad staph, those antibiotics are draining so hopefully he has some cardio come fight day.

    Secret Juice‚Ñ¢Ô∏è helps recovery. If the fight is off it‚Äôs Chen Chen‚Äôs fault

    Not really an excuse, staph infections can be really serious things depending on the severity. Dustin Poirier not too long ago was hospitalized for a few days with one. Look into what happened with Kevin Randleman and staph, shit is no joke
