Y’all think they promised Islam an immediate rematch if he loses to volk for agreeing to a last minute opponent change? Islam has yet to defend the belt against a lightweight contender. Technically he shouldn’t get an immediate rematch

Gaethje next. Volk vs Gaethje sounds really good

He would score a 200 with that bowling balls head

Dana never promises immediate rematches before the fight



UFC would say fuck the rematch in a heartbeat if they can make more money elsewhere

I think it depends on what Volkanovski decides to do next. He's said he still wants to fight Ilia Topuria at UFC 297, while his manager has said they'll stay at lightweight.

Volkanovski is doing the UFC a huge favour by stepping in on short notice too, so he'll likely be able to call the shots in regards to what happens next. That might mean that Makhachev either has to fight again while Volkanovski deals with Topuria before getting a rematch or sit out and risk getting skipped over.

With Volkanovski at lightweight, he might even look to get that McGregor paycheck if McGregor returns and actually fights/beats Chandler.

Holy shit I would pay real dollars for Volk vs Mac

If a world exist where Volk dominates and gets Islam out of there in round 2 by everyone’s oliveira logic he doesn’t deserve a rematch.

You know Oliviera got an immediate rematch he rejected right?

Much as I like Islam, nah he wouldnt deserve. He had a close decision as his only defence and losing to a short notice guy means he would need 1-2 wins before challenging again. Much rather see Gaethje vs Volk in the meantime.

Tho Im pretty sure Dana would set up an immediate rematch. Alot of money involved

Vegas would prefer volk vs gaethe if it were to be a option. Islam has found his region and Dana is kinda milking that. Islam is the only Muslim right now that can headline a card.

100% UFC will milk a trilogy if that happens
