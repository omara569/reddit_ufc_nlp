Same people who said strickland couldnt beat adesanya because he got KO'ed by Pereira, mma math doesnt work and this is a completely different weight class with a completely different opponent

I had someone on here argue with me that MMA math sometimes is correct, so it sometimes works.

Average r/ufc user is sped.

Burns dropped usman at the beginning of their fight too. Should be close depending on how much usman has regressed from his peak
