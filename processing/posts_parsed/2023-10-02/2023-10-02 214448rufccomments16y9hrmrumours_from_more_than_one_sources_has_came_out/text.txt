Rumours from more than one sources has came out that Joe will be featured in GTA6, but dude didn't have time for UFC 5 i guess?

    This is a perfect match for Joe. He matches the setting so perfectly

    Joe Rogan has publically stated that he hated doing the UFC games and doesn't want to do them. Then people get annoyed because he "doesn't have time for them".
