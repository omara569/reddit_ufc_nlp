Khamzat Chimaev vs Gilbert Burns - i forgot how fun this fight was
Could Paulo Costa bring a similar fight to Chimaev and with a bigger presence? Gilbert is a smaller welterweight and still put it on him.

I think Khamzat wanted a war and got one in this fight, didn't follow the gameplan. He needed this experience but I'm sure we won't see a fight like this from him anytime soon, if he hadn't learned this lesson we would've gotten a totally different fight when he fought Holland but instead he stuck to the gameplan he had and finished him as fast as he could.

Costa is def a lot durable so I don't think it's gonna end in R1 but if Khamzat is able to get him down and isn't afraid of the sub attempts from Costa I see him submitting Costa.
