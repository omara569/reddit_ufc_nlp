    My dude fought Bobby Knuckles, Costa, and Gastelum, but lost to De’sean Strickland. MMA math is weird.

    izzy’s coaches couldn’t adapt and shift their game plan for sean and they left izzy like a fish out of water

    100% agree with this, his coaches left him out to dry. That being said, Izzy looked perfectly content to just let the loss happen, didn't make any big effort to fight back after losing 3/4 of the first rounds

    I honestly feel like that fight gave most ppl a reality check in the ufc. Don’t get me wrong, Izzy is a crazy technical striker and just knows his shit all around. I could never be a Izzy hater. However even if you know all this, that, and some more, somebody with good head movement and a clean ass 1-2, is perfectly capable of getting the job done.

    It also shows how bs fans perception of "styles make fights are" before the Strickland fight it was Izzy's style is made to crack strickland, and now the concesus for fans is that being a defensive pressure striker who stays in close quarters beats a ranged striker. It's also what i love about mma being a 1v1 sport since its gameplan v gameplan, with noone to support you if theirs a crack in it, it's basically why I like technical boring fights just as much as i do just bleed fights

    There was a minute left in the last round and Izzy didn’t throw any offensive shots knowing he was down 4-1

    While Sean stood there with his arms down, yelling at him. Izzy could’ve tried to throw something heavy, but didn’t. Dude just gave up.
