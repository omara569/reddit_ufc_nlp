The duality of being an MMA fan

Why tf would anyone want to see Paddy rematch Gordon? Seriously there is no damn point. Paddy loses now what do we do a trilogy? Nobody wanted to see it the first time, we damn sure didn’t give AF the second time, the third time would be so stupid. But what if Paddy wins? Literally nothing changes everybody who hates him still hates him, those who like him still like him. Dumb matchup so glad they moved on and gave Paddy someone we want to see him fight.

It’s OK to have conflicting opinions. That’s what makes this sport great

Sooooo many people were saying Tony would beat Paddy before the fight was announced looooo

I was saying three of Tony's losses ago that he might not even beat Paddy, and if that fight got booked I wouldn't watch it.

Probably gonna stick to that. I'll watch the rest of the card but I'm not watching this bum ass clown beat up Tony as a finale to one of the hardest to watch skids in the history of the sport.
