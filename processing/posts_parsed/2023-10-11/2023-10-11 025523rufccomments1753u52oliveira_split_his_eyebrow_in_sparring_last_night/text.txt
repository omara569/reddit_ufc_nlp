    Is this truly worth the pullout? Genuine question

    depends how big the cut is. Could open up early in the round and affect his vision, or worse the doctor stops it if the cut becomes bigger as it experiences more physical trauma

    it could open easily in the fight but my question is how deep is the cut

    They released pics and it was pretty nasty. Definitely reminded me of the Diaz masvidal cut that stopped their fight

    how are you sparring that hard 10 days out? I guess it could just be part of the glove catching the skin or some shit but come on...
