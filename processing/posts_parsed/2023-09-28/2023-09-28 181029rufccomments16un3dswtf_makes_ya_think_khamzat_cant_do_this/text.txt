Even if it was something magical, just look at what he's doing lol ppl talk about size as if skills and technique don't work. Uriah didnt even do anything extraordinary, hes just flat out doing something I guarenteed no wrestling coach has ever told any of their guys to defend a takedown by covering your face lol

Dude if you watch flights where he fights people that mix in grappling he usually gets taken down

Exactly. People think Paulo has good defensive grappling because he defended against Yoel and the ghost of Rockhold.

Yoel doesn’t have the cardio to chain wrestle and he has weak top control. Rockhold never had good takedowns, just strong top control.

Khamzat is levels above current MW grapplers and everyone will see

I feel like Costa's physique tricks us every single time into thinking he has a better chance than he does.
