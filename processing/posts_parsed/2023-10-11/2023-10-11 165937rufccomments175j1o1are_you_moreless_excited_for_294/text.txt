Are you more/less excited for 294?
I’m honestly more excited, sucks about the short notice. But overall I think these two are more evenly matched than Islam and Charles. I think Charles would’ve improved and put up a better fight, but ultimately I think Islam’s top pressure would earn him a decision 3-2 or 4-1.
