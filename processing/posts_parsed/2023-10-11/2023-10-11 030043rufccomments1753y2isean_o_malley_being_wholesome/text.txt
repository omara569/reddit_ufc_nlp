    Despite being a big cornball he actually has always seemed like your average nice guy

    He’s said that had he not started fighting, he would have been working with special needs people.

    Didn’t he used to work with special needs kids before he got into fighting full time?
  
    Outside of his corny shtick he’s been growing on me lately. I haven’t listened to his pod but I hear he’s an average cool guy

    He’s a decent dude that knows how to market himself. In his eyes: any attention is good attention. Anything that makes someone watch his social media, tune into one of his fights is a win for him.
  
    Outside of his “undefeated” schtick he’s actually entertaining. His pod is pretty decent, and whenever he’s on other pod’s he makes it exciting.
  
    Big fan of his

    Imagine Sean drops the pad then starts dribbling before caving the lil fuckers skull in with a 1-2
