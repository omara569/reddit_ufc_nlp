Idk if it’s unpopular but my favorite is Nina. Not because she’s a hot Latina but she actually makes good content that isn’t some stupid generic shit like “ooh ooh hi WHO is YOUR next FIGHT” or some stupid shit every other reporter asks.Who is your favorite UFC media person?

    Not her. She's actually not terrible, and her pretty privilege allows her to ask things other MMA journalists can't and because she's not an MMA insider fighters don't really take her too seriously so they'll lower their guard around her a bit more than they would in a legit interview. But instead of asking anything hard-hitting she's usually asking some dumb shit that will play well on TikTok.
  
    I think my biggest issue with her is that she's 100% an industry plant. She just came out of nowhere and is given access that almost no journo is afforded. Why not give an opportunity to someone who actually knows and cares about the sport?
  
    But they gotta get those clicks.

    Agreed, even though I like her videos sometimes. The only issue I have with her however is that she keeps claiming to be fucking Italian

    I’m sorry but she’s hardly a good media person, more of an influencer. Plus her throwing shade unprovoked at Helen made me lose all respect
