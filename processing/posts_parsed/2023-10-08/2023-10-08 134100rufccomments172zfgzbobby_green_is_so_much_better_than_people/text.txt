    Always rated him highly ever since his fight against Fiziev. But he's just one of those fighters who has a couple of decent wins against very good opponents. Then loses a couple against great, and very good fighters themselves.
  
    So it always feels like he's there. But going nowhere. So his value is kind of meh.

    Why? Because he made short work of some dude we've never heard of before?
