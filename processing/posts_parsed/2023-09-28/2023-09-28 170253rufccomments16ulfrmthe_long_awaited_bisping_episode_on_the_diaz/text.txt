Nate probably deserves it. Nick probably doesn't, if he wasn't suspended for 5 years cause of fucking weed, then who knows.

Nick held the WEC belt before the ufc bought them out.  He absolutely was a star before the WEC was then merged with the UFC.  That shouldn't be ignored.

GSP held the belt for that weight class in the UFC at the time.  It made for some great drama, and led to Diaz calling GSP out.  It all brought in views.

Add then his fights with Penn, Condit, GSP and Anderson Silva....

You would have to be an absolute clown to think that Nick doesn't deserve to be in the UFC hall of Fame.   Nate deserving to be in, isn't just an extension of that, he has had a very long ufc career and faced some of the best to ever fight in the ufc, in multiple weight classes.

Then, if donald cerrone deserves to be in the ufc hall of fame, denying either of the Diaz brothers would be criminally fucking stupid.
