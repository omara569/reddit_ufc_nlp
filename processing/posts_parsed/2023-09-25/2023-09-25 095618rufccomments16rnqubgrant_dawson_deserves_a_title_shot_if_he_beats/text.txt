    Maybe if the entire division was ducking Dawson the way they did islam you’d have a point. You can’t hate on the Dagestani rank jump when literally no one will sign

    Dawson the guy ranked 10th and who has missed weight in like half his UFC fights should get a title shot before Charles/Islam winner, Gaethje or even Gamrot for beating a unranked Bobby Green who is 3-4 in his last 7 fights?
  
    Are you stupid?

    Yeah, who am I kidding? Who would possibly get a title shot from beating Green.

    Hell nah lol, Dawson is a MFer, his grappling is just suffocating, but I don’t think the UFC will be in a rush to give him a title opportunity even if he keeps winning.
