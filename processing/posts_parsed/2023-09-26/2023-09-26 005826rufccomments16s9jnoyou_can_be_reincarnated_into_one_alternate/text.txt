Second option would be a banger

This is gonna be hard for some, but here we go: nobody beats Khabib.

Iâ€™d rather see Fedor vs Bones than either honestly

Why do we all sit here and act like Khabib wouldnâ€™t of tore his ass up ðŸ˜‚

Because prime Tony was pretty unstoppable.  This man was constantly fighting top contenders and had a pretty favorable stylistic matchup.  If course khabib is a monster and would be a favorite, but Tony would not have been an easy fight

Inject option A straight into my veins! From 2015-2018 I seriously doubt there was a lightweight walking on earth who could beat Tony. Only Khabib and even then it was close, not even taking into consideration he was extremely injury prone and very inactive

The one on the right, as much as I love El Cucuy he was going to lose against Khabib no matter what

I don't mind the left option as long he get the belt or fight for the belt against McGregor.

I would like tony to win the title and not fight khabib..even though as fans it would have been awesome ...don't think Tony would have won against khabib

I would like to see Izzy not touch his dog pee pee.
