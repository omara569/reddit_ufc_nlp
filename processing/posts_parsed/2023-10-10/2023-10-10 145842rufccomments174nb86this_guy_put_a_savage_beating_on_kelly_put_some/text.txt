This guy put a savage beating on Kelly. Put some respeck on Miniature Masvidal's name.

    Didn't he call him the wish version of Masvidal, leading up to this fight too ðŸ˜‚.

    Honestly he was piecing Rob Font up until he wasnâ€™t hahaha. I was rooting big time for Rob but Yanezâ€™s jab is a thing of beauty and once he gets his combinations rolling is hard to stop him

    Was really satisfying, but I really didnâ€™t get why this guy win took him from unranked to Number 14, then up to Number 12 just a shuffles later. Couldnâ€™t believe when I saw him get matched up with freaking Number 6 Ron Font and open as the favourite. Was too much too soon. Martinez this weekend is a much better matchup to introduce him to the top.

    Won't get much better till he stops running his own gym/camp and joins a real one instead
