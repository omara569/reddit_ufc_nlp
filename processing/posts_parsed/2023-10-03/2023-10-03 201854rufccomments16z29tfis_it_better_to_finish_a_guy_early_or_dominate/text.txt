is it better to finish a guy early or dominate them easily?

    Why not both?

    Dominating someone for a whole fight is more impressive to me. The longer a fight goes, the more easily you can tell the difference in skill since there's no room to say a guy just got caught

    This is why IzzyVsStrickland was so shocking. The vast majority of major upsets come off finishes, like GSPvsSerra 1 or NunesVsPeńa 1, puncher’s or grappler’s chance is always a factor in a fight and has allowed for comebacks plenty of times.
  
    To see a massive underdog like Strickland UD someone like Adesanya so comfortably shows a level skill beyond just being lucky.

    Getting 50-42ed by your opponent is a thing which makes you reconsider your career, this is insane

    If you get knocked out, you can always say 'well they go a lucky hit'You cant attribute a fisting to luck

    I always thought it was a more definitive way to win if you finish. However, after years of observing social media reactions, it looks like people will dispute/discredit a fighter's win more if it's a finish than if it's a dominant decision. So I guess just dominating them the whole time is the better, more decisive way to win in peoples' eyes. I still think finishes are cooler.

    Strickland is the biggest example that comes to mind. If he had finished Izzy when he dropped him people would’ve said he got lucky.

    Put it this way. Imagine if Sean koed Izzy in rd 1. 90% would be calling it a fluke or something. But after that dominant performance u can't say shit
