We have seen some absolute ass whoppings be scored 10-9 and some decent rounds be score 10-8 in the past but by far Gray Maynard’s 1st round against Frankie Edgar in their second fight is the closest thing we’ll ever get to a 10-7 round. Sucks that no judge agreed but this round is as close to finishing an opponent without actually doing itWhat is actually a 10-7 round

    Just checked, and most recent 10-7 rounds were Illia Vs Emmet, and Khamzat Vs John Phillips.
  
    So the recent precedents are right there for you.

    Yeah I remember those two rounds but I still think this one Maynard beating is still more justified for receiving a 10-7 score. Ilia did beat the shit outta Josh Emmet tho and Khamzat…well he’s Khamzat

    Maybe some round from Max Holloway vs Calvin Kattar or Brian Ortega ?

    Nah, 10-8 is fine for that.

    Me & my boy did a fight companion REwatch for Edgar vs. Maynard 2 this past week, this is crazy. We BOTH scored that Rd1 10-7 for Maynard based off Unified Rules of MMA. That was one helluva a beatdown, and total DOMINATION

    I know it's not the question, but a 10-7 shouldn't be possible barring a 10-8 that has a point deduction.

    Watch the first round of Edgar/Maynard 2. That’s about the best example of a 10-7.

    I actually kinda agree. 10-8 already means domination and losing an extra incredibly important point on top of that because you didn‘t land 1-2 good shots in one round is crazy. It‘s also a little random since the difference between the two is so small that it will be completely left to the judges randomness most of the time.
