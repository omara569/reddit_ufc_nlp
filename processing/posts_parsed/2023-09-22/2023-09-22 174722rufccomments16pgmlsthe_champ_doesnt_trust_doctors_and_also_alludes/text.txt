    I mean doctors were paid by Peudue to prescribe oxy at an alarmingly high rate and market it as safe and non habit forming, which basically kick started a major opiods crisis in the states. Costing millions their lives.
  
    Being prescribed something by a doctor and being skeptical is not being a "conspiracy theorists".
  
    Doctors and pharmaceutical companies have had a history of corruption and misinformation.
  
    "Purdue paid certain doctors ostensibly to provide educational talks to other health care professionals and serve as consultants, but in reality to induce them to prescribe more OxyContin."

    For real. I had surgery in 06 2 days before 18. Never done an opiate in my life. Decent family, but bought into the blame the addict campaign.  2 years later I was living out of my car. Then you have the biggest transfer of wealth in the pandemic and still want to call people conspiracy theorists.
