    It's his debut. He's no CM Punk. He should be the opener of early prelims

    Heâ€™s big, not huge. Fight Pass prelims might also be best for controversial figures like him, so as to not get a worse rep with the general public who might not look as favourably on his past behaviour.
  
    Beyond that, Bruno Silva is by no means a lame horse thrown to the slaughter. Bruno is absolutely capable of shutting this guy out, itâ€™ll just depend on whether or not he want to have an Alex Pereira performance, or a Gerald Meerschaert performance.

    This guy is piece of shit. He should be in the prelims, I hope he gets humbled.

    So is he only going to fight in the Middle East or Asia? If his other other is really messed up wonder how he would be sanctioned

    The next few weeks are going to be khabib can big accounts blowing their load over this guy. It's going to be a fucking nightmare.
