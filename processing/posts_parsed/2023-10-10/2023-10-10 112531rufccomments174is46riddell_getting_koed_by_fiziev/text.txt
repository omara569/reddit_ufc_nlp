Damn Riddell was my favourite prospect back then sad to see him on 3 fight L streak😭Riddell getting KO'ed by Fiziev

    That little split second "wave" he gives that signals "I'm done" right after that kick landed.

    He said he suddenly couldn't see anything which sounds pretty scary

    Fiziev timed that so well. As soon as Brad took that side step, boom.

    Herb Dean is either dialed in or completely zoned out no inbetween. Some of the best and worst stoppages in the game

    Almost like he's worked more fights than most refs ever will so he inevitably has good and bad performances

    I think he semi retired saying he needs to reevaluate himself and has just been coaching

    One of herb’s better stoppages tbh. Recognized Brad’s body language quick enough to keep him from taking a bunch of damage while momentarily blind.
  
    Honestly could’ve been bad if we got a few seconds of the classic “herb shuffle” while Fiziev combod off on a blind man
