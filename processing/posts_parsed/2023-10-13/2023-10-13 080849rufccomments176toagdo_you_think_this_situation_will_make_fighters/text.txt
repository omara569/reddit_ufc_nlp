do you think this situation will make fighters less likely to wanna be backup opponents

    Exactly. Free trip, 1st class hotel, and probally 50k. And he's in their good favors. It's still in his interest to say this is fine.

    Yeah, it's silly to question this.
  
    The guy is getting paid to train, make weight and be there just in case. That's it.
  
    At the same time it's a big opportunity, if things change last moment, he can fight and become a champion.
  
    Also, it builds his story. Media pieces made in the future will refer to him as the backup guy on UFC 294. There's a reason they picked him over Beniel. They want to build him up.

    The kid just doesn't wanna fight. Guys just don't get paid to not fight.

    The backup fighter is only there in case someone misses weight, if Volk or Islam come in over 155 he will take their spot

    Why would this situation be bad for gamrot? He‚Äôs still the backup. They lost the fight they initially scheduled for 294 so they created a different matchup.

    Yeah they had enough notice that they didn't need to activate the backup. It makes sense to have the backup still there for emergency situations closer to the fight.
