I did the mistake to read comments (How you can be familiar with ufc and still think that prime dc, who is a top 10 best fighter of all time, does not choke out tyson is wild. 90s mma already showed that boxer vs grappler is not evne a close competition)

    Sensationalism is a disease in combat sports. Mike Tyson is a more popular name than Daniel Cormier in sports. It could be a competition to make the best balloon animal and they’d still say Tyson takes it because of his uppercut.
  
    (Tyson probably makes a mean pigeon tho)

    Daniel Cormier does not I repeat DOES NOT make balloon animals regularly. This would be an  intriguing match up IMO
