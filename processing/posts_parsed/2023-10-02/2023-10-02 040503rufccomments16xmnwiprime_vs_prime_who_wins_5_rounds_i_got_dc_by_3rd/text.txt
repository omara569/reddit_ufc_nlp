Fedor was way more explosive, a better striker and is not being outgrappled by DC.

At his absolute best the only guys I think that could possibly take Fedor were Cain Velasquez and Jon Jones.

Prime Fedor beats him, alongside anybody else. Stylistically Fedor isn't going to get outgrappled, and had bombs in his hand and would have been a lot faster than DC.

Nah, no chance, Fedor by knockout or sub. DC's style would not work in the slightest, wrestling is basically ineffective to high level judo (learnt from experience too many times), his dirty boxing/mummy guard wouldn't work because Fedor is too explosive and knows how to setup better shots. I don't really know who could have beaten real Prime fedor

Fedor. It wouldn't even be close to be honest.

DC because different generations. MMA keeps evolving. A top 15 fighter now would probably beat th current champion 15 years ago

You think fucking Tybura or Spivak are beating Cro Cop or Fedor, or Big Nog?  People overrate how much MMA has improved esp at HW
