USADA is out next year

    Seems strange for them to use McGregor as the reason, he entered a couple days ago, they're exiting end of December and saying they hope UFC should honour that fact?
  
    Did the UFC strong arm them into non renewal so he could come back sooner? Or are USADA using McGregor as the scapegoat for their contract not being renewed?
  
    Either way I hope some sort of reputable testing body can be put in place.

    Never happening. USADA fucked with UFC big time here, don’t think UFC will ever have a loose thread again like this. Probably easiest for the brass to go down the One route and pretend PED testing doesn’t exist at all lol.

    I think McGregor was genuinely ready to fight this year and USADA pissed off Dana by making him wait it out
