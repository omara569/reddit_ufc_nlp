What would be the results if their first 3 fights were not cancelled?

    Tony's best chance was the first one. #3 onwards it's 100% Khabib, with finishes.

    I think fight 1 could be close and am willing to entertain that Tony had a chance in it. I think fight 2 and 3 probably look like basically every other Khabib fight. And there is also a solid chance fight 1 would have also looked like nearly every other Khabib fight

    Khabib Smash, Khabib Smash, Khabib Mercy Smash

    There wouldn't need to be 3 fights, Khabib would have only needed 1 fight to completely dominate Ferguson and prove a point

    Khabib wins
  
    Tony got about all he could handle on the ground against a no-name like Danny Castillo and that was around the same time frame as when the first three bouts between Khabib and Tony Ferguson were supposed to take place, so...

    After seeing the Kevin Lee Tony fight.
  
    I personally believe Tony wouldâ€™ve had no chance in this fight regardless of when it took place

    Well, Khabib had a close fight with Tibau, right? Whom Tony submitted.

    I think Khabib rips off one of Ferguson's arms and chokes him with it in all 3 fights.
  
    Tony is a bum. We just didn't know it yet.
