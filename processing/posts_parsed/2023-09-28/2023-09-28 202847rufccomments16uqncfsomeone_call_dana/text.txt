    Rip to the first few cejudos whose heads exploded closing the distance for the other clones ðŸ˜”

    I guess this is a tragic memory but in elementary school Id imagine our whole school swarming an active shooter. Sure the first couple kids would get shot but ultimately wed tackle him and cook him to death with our vibrating bodies like a swarm of bees.
  
    That is how I imagine Ngannou vs 11 Cejudos

    Wait...., if a cejudo only weighs about 23 pounds each, could ngannou just use one of them as a bowling ball to take out the other 10?

    Who would win, the top 5 HW or the top 15 Fly Weight?

    This is a way better brawl.  I think this would come down to coordination.
  
    5 ngannous telepathically linked would MONSTER 15 unlinked Cejudos, but without a link, I reckon Cejudo works with himself far more effectively and might be able to properly coordinate a beatdown

    I think 4 Cejudos absolutely murder Francis.
