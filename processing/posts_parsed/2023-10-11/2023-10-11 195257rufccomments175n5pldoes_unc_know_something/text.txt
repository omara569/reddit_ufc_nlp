The payday would be the best Seanâ€™s ever had.

Chael Sonnen is personal friends with Sean Strickland so he may know. If Sean does take the fight though new champion Chimaev.

Chael prob just throwing it out there just in case it's him so he can say I called it lmao. I hope it's actually true tho.

I can see it. I think he doesn't enjoy the pressure of having the belt, that's part of why he diminishes it in conversation. Living the life of something like a Cowboy Cerrone is what he wants

Dc did say it would blow our mind and only Izzy and Strickland would blow my mind no one else.

This woud be terrible for Sean... I want him to have time to prepare for his first title defense.
