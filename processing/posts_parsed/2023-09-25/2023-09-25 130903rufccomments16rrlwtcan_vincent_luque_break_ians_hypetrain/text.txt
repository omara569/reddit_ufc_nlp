    I want to see Luque fight but I never want to see him get punched in the head again.

    Quite confused about what happened. I know he suffered some kind of brain injury and was out for a while. But it seems like his condition is still a thing? Hows he supposed to fight then?

    After watching Luque have no head movement in the Geoff Neal fight I don’t have confidence

    I feel like no. Ian Garry is cringe af but I feel like he's actually good.

    How did Luque even get cleared to ever fight again?

    About 2-3 years ago I considered Luque to be the dark horse of the WW division. I still think he's extremely dangerous, just had some unfortunate setbacks. If he can hold a good defensive distance from Gary's striking and utilize his grappling/G&P, he definitely has a strong chance.

    He’s sort of like the new Martin Kampmann. Super fun fights, always up for a good scrap, can main event a fight night card, can beat some elite guys but will get eaten alive by the truly elite fighters of his division.

    I never understood the Dark Horse thing about Luque, anyone who was getting banged up by Bryan Barberena is no where near championship level
