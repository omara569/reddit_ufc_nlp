    gaethje went on jre talking abt how at this stage in his career he doesn't take short notices. Gamrot is not an attractive contender. volk double champ is

    The fight was literally already sold. ‚ÄúRematch in Abu Dhabi‚Äù that‚Äôs what they talked about after the fight.
  
    They‚Äôre not gonna wait another whole year to put it on. Unless Volk wins then it‚Äôs an even bigger trilogy. Beat each other in each others hometowns etc.

    Not sure Gaethje would have taken this on 11 days notice, rightfully so. Feel bad for Gamrot though, they did him kinda dirty

    No one did Gamrot dirty at all, he would‚Äôve had the flukiest title shot ever. He doesn‚Äôt deserve it and no one wants to see him fight Islam but everyone wants to see Islam run it back with Volk

    This is Justin's last chance for that belt he's not fighting the number 3 pfp in less than 2 weeks.  Gamrot is buns as well ufc did him a favour by not having him step in

    Sean Strickland gets a title shot off of abus magomedov and everyone sleeps
  
    Gamrot gets a title shot off of being the fucking backup fighter for a title fight and everyone loses their DAMN minds
