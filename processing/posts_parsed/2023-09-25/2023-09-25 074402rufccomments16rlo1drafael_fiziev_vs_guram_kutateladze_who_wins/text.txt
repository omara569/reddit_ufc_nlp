    Right this second? Probably Guram since Fiziev snapped his knee up two days ago.

    Fiziev is leagues above Guram. Guram's win over Gamrot was a robbery

    No, it was not a robbery. Guram did more damage, Guram dropped Gamrot. Guram just lost, so you underestimate him. Recency bias in action.
