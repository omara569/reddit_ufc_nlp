If Colby can‚Äôt beat Leon, Usman‚Äôs legacy turns to pulp. Jorge twice, Colby twice, burns.

    Dumbest take I‚Äôve heard. Has it occurred to you that usman was on the decline, especially with his fucked knees? Not to mention, the fighters that fight the fighters that usman has beat has no relevant relation to his legacy, he‚Äôs still a beast.

    What the fuck are you talking about? Who you beat is your legacy as a fighter. It's all of your legacy

    That could very well just mean that Leon is that good

    Masvidal is not champ material at all, can you give Usman credit for beating a top 10 fighter which is expected to beat? Burns is a top 5 guy but not champ material either. Colby was suppose to be the guy that Usman stopped but if Colby can‚Äôt win the belt then was he really that guy? You get me?
