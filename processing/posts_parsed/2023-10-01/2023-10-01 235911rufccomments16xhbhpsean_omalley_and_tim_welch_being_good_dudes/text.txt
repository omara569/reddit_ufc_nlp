They genuinely seem like good dudes. All you guys making the special need kids the butt of your jokes, you suck, grow the fuck up.

Yeah man I got a special place in my heart for those lil guys (no pun intended obviously), because I know they didn’t ask for their disability yet I’m sure they were mocked frequently in school. I actually read an article that Sean had only made $74k at the time from UFC and won a Fortnite tourney and donated like all $27k or whatever to a charity that benefits children with special needs. Great dude, and I’m sure his coach is just as much a standup guy doing these things with Suga

Fun fact: Sean used to work there before he went pro and still lived in Montana
