    Jailton Almeida is overshadowed by Jones, Cyril and Aspinall

    He's a newer fighter. One more win and he will be in the top five.

Tatsuro Taira: Heâ€™s not a world-beater yet but he has a lot of potential given the skills heâ€™s displayed at his age. Already 4-0 in the UFC and 14-0 overall at 23 years old.
  
Rinya Nakamura: Heâ€™s a former U23 World Champion like Bo Nickal and placed 5th in the World Championships so heâ€™s an elite wrestler. Already 2-0 in the UFC and 8-0 overall at 28 years old.
  
Anthony Cassar: Heâ€™s a 1x NCAA Division I champion and 1x Big Ten Conference champion who was teammates with Bo Nickal and now trains with him at ATT. Heâ€™s the only man to ever beat Gable Steveson, aka the 2020 Olympic gold medalist in Freestyle at 125kg, when he was competing in Folkstyle during college and he did it twice in the 285lb weight division. Heâ€™s only 1-0 in MMA but heâ€™s 27 years old and will likely dominate his way to the UFC with his wrestling.
  
    Edit: Cameron Saaiman and Michael Morales also feel underrated considering theyâ€™re both young, undefeated fighters.
