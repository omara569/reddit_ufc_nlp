I think people need to rewatch Usman Edwards 2 again. Usman looked the best he’s ever looked from rounds 2-4.

    I think people need to remember the narrative going into this fight and how clearly Usman dominated the P4P #1 talks. Usman’s striking looked the best it had ever looked as he began mixing in more body shots into his striking.
  
    I write this as a Chimaev enthusiast, because I’m very aware of how fickle fans are. Just a year ago, Usman was undisputedly the P4P best fighter in the world. It’s hard for me to imagine that he is completely washed like people are thinking going into this fight.
  
    Expect an absolute brawl from Kamaru and Khamzat. I haven’t been this excited for a card since I began watching the UFC.

    I think getting absolutely slept and then thoroughly beaten in the second fight is definitely going to affect Usmans mentality. Not sure if that's going to make him better or worse, but I expect him to come out aggressively and to try and make a point.
  
    I would've rather seen Paulo v Chimaev but I'm very interested to see how Usman does at 185. I do wish it was 5 rounds since Usman has god tier cardio and khamzat has not fought past a 3rd round (at least in the ufc, not sure outside of that)

    Head kicks change lives
  
    Usmans career is going to be clearly defined pre and post head kick

    Why would Usman vs Leon 2 be more relevant in any way than Usman vs Leon 3?

    This fight was only a year ago brother. To say we should only evaluate fighters based on their last performance doesnt make much sense to me.
  
    Yes Usman fought worse in the second fight but that doesnt mean he is strictly on a decline now. Fighters bounce back all the time.

    this is a stretch but it made me think of chael v anderson. Chael was about to win and got caught at the last second. Then in the rematch, he was beaten soundly. Then he went up in weight and faced some other wrestlers in Jon and Rashad and didn't make it out of the first round. I give Usman a better shot against Chimaev obviously though; just a random thought I had thinking back to Usman's successes in the Leon fight.
