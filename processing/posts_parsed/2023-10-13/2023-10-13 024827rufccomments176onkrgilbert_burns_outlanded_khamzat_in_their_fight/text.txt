Gilbert burns outlanded Khamzat in their fight. Usman outlanded Gilbert 2:1. Both fight lasted 3 rounds but look at the difference in striking ability

Usman has much better accuracy.

Khamzat doesn't allow the same pace as we saw in Usman vs Burns.

Not saying Usman can't handle the uptick but completely different style of fights. Burns was able to adjust nicely but only won round 3. Will be interesting how Usman adjusts to it especially coming in on short notice.

Usman has no BJJ.

Cummies won't mind wrestling.

So many people are trying to do mma math but it's like we forgot what happened the last time we did that (adesanya vs strickland) this is a different weight class, a different stylistic matchup and it's short notice
