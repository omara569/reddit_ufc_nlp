Dude should wait till Leon eventually loses the title, then rematch Leon because their fight ended weird, and then he can probably get a title shot

He needs to 2v1 Usman and Colby for a shot at a Burns rematch

If weâ€™re being realistic: Belal has to finish Pavlovic within the first round whilst having one hand tied behind his back, the soles of both his feet covered in Vaseline, also blindfolded and reciting a Sammy Davis Jr song in fluent Japanese before he should be considered as the back-up fighter for a first contender fight. Seems fair to me

Gotta get that MW strap before he can even hope to sniff a WW title shot. /s

Poor Belal lmao

This must be a joke?? Belal should earn his shot just like the rest of the fighters!

Pretty sure Wonderboy deserves a rematch (no wrestling allowed!), and Sean Brady should get a fair shake at Belal (without any threats by fans). Only then can Belal compete for the title contender spot against Khamzat.
