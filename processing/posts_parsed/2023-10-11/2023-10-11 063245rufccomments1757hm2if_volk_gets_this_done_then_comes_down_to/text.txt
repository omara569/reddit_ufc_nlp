If Volk gets this done, then comes down to dominate Ilia he will be the greatest to ever do it

    I think some recency bias is at work here but it would be pretty amazing.

    Agreed, but it‚Äôd put him in the argument for top five.

    What's crazy is, regardless is if he wins or not, he'll still fight Ilia in January

    Lots of recency bias at play here. Nobody is really touching Jon Jones' legacy just yet. Volk lost twice, failed when attempting to move up, etc.
  
    JJ is wild due to the following facts; he never actually lost, youngest UFC champ ever, highest title defenses (11), champ in two weight classes, most wins in UFC title fights (15), and longest unbeaten streak inside the UFC.

    Volk hasnt surpassed GSP let alone Jones. He would take aldos, and khabibs place tho, and i have khabib above Aldo so hed be like #4 under silva.
