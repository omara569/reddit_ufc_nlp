Even with Tony's terrible record recently, I think I speak for the entire world when I say I pray to every god out there that he wins. I'm British and absolutely despise Pimblett. Just a cunt of a human.

This is going to be really interesting. Tony in his day would smoke Paddy so hard... Probably still will. But this is not his day. Justin is a bad man.
