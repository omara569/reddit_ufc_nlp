If Tony wins his fight against paddy, what do you honestly think his next move will be?

    Another half dozen tweets about how Khabib is still running scared of him

    Hard to tell if this is a joke or a real prediction, because it could easily be a valid prediction 🥲

    He’s hitting his prime you idiots. Tony lost 5 fights before saying something along the lines of “I’m back!” after losing to Nate. He fell short against Bobby Green but it’s all calculated. Win 12, lose 6, Win 12 then hopefully a shot at an interim belt

    From his interview just now he seems the clearest he’s been recently. I think he realizes this is it and I hope he goes out on a win.
