Has the UFC ever had a better HW roster?

    we can appreciate their muscles at least, we rarely get to appreciate them fighting each other.

    I actually think the former division Like 2014-2018 was the best.
  
    Ngannou, stipe, werdum, overeem, Cain, JDS, Mark Hunt, Derrick Lewis, Travis Browne, big country.
  
    It was so fun back then

    I liked just prior to that when you also had mir, carwin and Lesnar but without Ngannou.

    I'm super excited for Pav, Aspinall, and Almeida. One of them will get the belt for sure after Jones retires

    Those are the guys for sure.
  
    I think Blaydes still has a shot and Gane also if he starts taking this shit seriously. But wither way the division is alive and well. Especially compared to a few years ago.

    Brock Lesnar, Frank Mir, Cro Cop, Big Nog, Randy Couture, Cain Velazquez, Werdum, Shane Carwin, Dos Santos, throw Stipe Miocic and Daniel Cormier in there too
