I'd consider creating a 165lbs division. There are a lot of big lightweights who could move up and a lot of small welterweights that could move down. 15lbs is a big difference and it puts fighters in a tricky position of picking.        What y'all think? Which fighters could you see fighting in your made up division?You can add one new division to the UFC. What's the limit and why?

    Atomweight is the most likely to get added next imo.
  
    They'll want to add a belt if women's featherweight is dead so they don't lose opportunities to market a card as having a title fight.
  
    They want to grow their presence in Asia, where women's atomweight already exists in other promotions. They've already opened a PI in Shanghai. Weili Zhang vs Yan Xiaonan could be marketed as coaches for an Ultimate Fighter Asia season used to shake out division rankings.

    Ultra heavyweight: 265 to unlimited pounds. May the fattest man win.

    Imagine round 5 in this division. It will be like slow motion.

    Super heavyweight. Let’s see some big boys in there. Gives JBJ opportunity to move up again to fight the likes of worlds strongest men.

    I really would love to include cruiserweight (205-225 lbs), however I'm not too keen it would produce a lot of talent

    Add 160 and shift the other divisions around by a few pounds
  
    Below 185 is where most of the extreme cuts occur

    Listen...
  
    125lb - Flyweight
  
    135lb - Bantamweight
  
    145lb - Featherweight
  
    155lb - Lightweight
  
    165lb - Welterweight
  
    180lb - Middleweight
  
    195lb - Cruiserweight
  
    220lb - Light Heavyweight
  
    220+lb - Heavyweight
  
    Larger lightweights can now more easily move up to welterweight and smaller heavyweights around 240ish now have a more deserving weight class. In addition the largest athletes (think NFL lineman types) can now compete in the UFC without worrying about a meaningless weight cut
  
    Edit: could also make heavyweight weight limit 285

    I would extend all of the classes LW and above by 5 pounds, so LW now ends at 160, WW 175, MW 190, etc. Leave FLW/FW/BW exactly as they are. This will extend the weight range for LW and raise the weight for everything above.
  
    And then I would add super heavyweight 270+ no limit.
