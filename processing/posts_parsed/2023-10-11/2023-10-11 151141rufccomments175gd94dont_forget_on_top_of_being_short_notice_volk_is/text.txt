Don’t forget: on top of being short notice, Volk is also dealing with Coach Khabib this time

    Everybody who's saying he's not cornering Islam - that was what was said when he was fighting Oliveira. He very well may say fuck it and corner him because it's Volk

    Right. And he clearly has been more involved in this camp, according to Islam

    Islam has publicly stated in an interview a few days ago that khabib will not be in his corner during the fight

    This situation sucks for both fighters imo. If Volk loses he's not getting another rematch unless guaranteed rematch was part of the deal for this one which I doubt. If Islam wins it does nothing for him, and if he wins but it's even a close fight he will get hate, if Islam loses then he just lost to a featherweight on like a week's notice. The only way anyone comes out on top is if Volk somehow manages the win.

    Calling it now, khabib is gonna surprise us all and corner volk. Anyone who disagrees is a casual and an idiot and I hate you
