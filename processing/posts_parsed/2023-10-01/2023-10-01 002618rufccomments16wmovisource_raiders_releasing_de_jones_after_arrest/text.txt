    Jon doesn't care in the slightest about him. Chandler literally called Jon a POS and said he was never there for him. The deleted tweets he had went into depth saying Jon is a wifebeater and never deserved any of the fame and attention. they literally hate each other

    “Chandler was never my brother” - Jon probably
