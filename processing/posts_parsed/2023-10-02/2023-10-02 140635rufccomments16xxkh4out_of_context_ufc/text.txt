The moment volk realized that not only could Islam take him down, he could keep him down... and there wasn't a damned thing that he could do about it other than to make faces and cry.

Funny how Islam had volk in this position for half the match, but volks fans think that volks 60 seconds of top control in round 5 somehow made it "a close fight".   lolz
