    Easiest win/win situation for Volk
  
    If he loses - blames on short notice, broken hand, fighting in abu dhabiIf he wins - best fighter ever lived who has beaten dominant champion in his own backyard on 1 week notice
  
    no wonder he jumped on the opportunity lmao

    It’s still another loss on his record if he loses, so it’s not win/win. But I don’t think he took the opportunity because of the excuses he’ll be able to make if he loses. I think he genuinely believes he can win. I hope Volk wins, but I think this fight will be easier than the first for Islam. Fights on homesoil, more time to redhydrate and won’t underestimate Volk like he did in the first fight.

    AND if he was training, it was likely for the FW match with Ilia. He won't even have time to properly bulk up to LW this time

    Islam by finish this time. I felt like Volk fought the perfect fight with the perfect preparation last time out, this time he won't have that benefit, and he won't likely have the cardio advantage this time either
