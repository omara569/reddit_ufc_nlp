Islam's striking is actually very refined. He has come a long way.

Yeah he's got one of the best striking coaches in the game - Javier Mendez.

His striking defense is crazy. He ducked so many swings and pulled out of range of other ones.

Oliveira needs to add some solid head movement in his arsenal or else he's gonna get clipped repeatedly in the rematch. The high guard and stepping back will only get you so far.

Let's be honest he never will. Guy has been in the UFC since he was barely an adult, he's figured out a style that got him to the elite levels of the game he can't change much at this point it either works or it doesn't.

Lol, Oliveira's reaction when Islam lands that first punch

He is like "damn, it's gonna be a long night"

Look at the way he was chasing Islam, got stunned and backed away

Islam's standup is underrated because of his ground dominance and relationship with Khabib. Dude is a straight up great striker. He's a killer on his feet and a murderer on the ground.

Islam kept missing that hook until Charles threw that short flying knee and left himself at the right range to receive it ðŸ˜¯
