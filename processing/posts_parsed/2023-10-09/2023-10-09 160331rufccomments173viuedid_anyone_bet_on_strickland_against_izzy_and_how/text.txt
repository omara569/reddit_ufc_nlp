    I was watching the fight on my phone outside of a bar and when Strickland almost finished Izzy in the first I started screaming uncontrollably.
  
    I quickly realized that there were innocent bystanders in the environment and, out of respect for them, I decided to get up and walk down an alley around the side of the building to watch the fight in privacy.
  
    There was a gentleman sitting on a bench at the side of the building and out of excitement I said to him ‚ÄúLFG‚Äù
  
    He asked me what I was watching and I replied ‚ÄúStrickland Adesanya‚Äù
  
    We watched the rest of the fight together right there on my phone. It turns out he put money on Strickland as part of a parlay.
  
    I felt like I was on ecstacy watching Strickland dominate Adesanya for five rounds. Definitely one of my favorite memories as a UFC fan!

    My buddy I watched with had $300 on him at around +700. He also had $300 on O‚ÄôMalley which was like +250 iirc. So he‚Äôs up around $3000 from the last couple PPVs lol

    $500 won $2500. 3k back all together. Between both Sean's I took Ceasars for 9k. Jonny boy gonna cash me out. And we just might have to play covington.
