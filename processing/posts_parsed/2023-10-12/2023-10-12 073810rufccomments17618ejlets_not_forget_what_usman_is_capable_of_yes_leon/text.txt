Let's not forget what Usman is capable of. Yes Leon got his number but he is still an active fighter and second after GSP in WW.

    Never realized how powerful Usman's jab is. You really hear it everytime it lands.

    Unless Khamzat has made massive strides in his boxing defense he is going to eat that jab. As long as Usman has kept it as sharp as in the Burns fight, it could be a real problem if he can force Khamzat to strike.

    Usman stopped Burns with jabs. People keep saying all the time that Usman is washed and his knees are gone but i legit believe he can stop Khamzat inside those 3 rounds. You dont become one of most dominant fighters by pure luck and he will show it soon

    I was initially worried about his knees after hearing about it but I'm actually not too concerned since he's never really shown any signs that it's dramatically affected his performance.
  
    I think it's going to really come down to Khamzat. If he's going to bum rush Usman, the results I feel would be hard to say what the outcome would be, but in my opinion it's not something you want to do when you're taking on high level guys. I don't believe he is going to be able to stay calculated against Usman, after seeing him abandon his gameplay and swang-n-bang with Burns. Unless the time off really disciplined him, you look at guys like Gaethje and it is possible, but this is a huge fight for Khamzat, he's got the home crowd, he's doesn't seem like the type of guy who will fight a boring fight.

    I have no idea where this narrative came from that he is just so washed and gone. He is coming off of two losses in title fights against the same guy. The first one he was dominating up until maybe the coolest and most iconic come from behind victory. The second one he lost to the current champ in what was a competitive fight. I don‚Äôt see how two losses to the current champ, who no one else in the division has beaten either, implies you‚Äôre washed. JDS never got the title back but he had a ton of fight left in him and even another crack at the title after losing to Cain twice. DC dropped two to Jon just to go on to beat everyone else in the division he ever fought. Holloway? Whittaker? My stepdad?

    This man deserves more respect. What a spectacular run! To be honest, he only had 1-2 ‚Äúboring‚Äù fights in his championship reign and they weren‚Äôt his fault.

    I honestly don't even think his fight with Tyron Woodley was boring. His body shots in the clinch against the cage were nice.. I didn't appreciate the performance at the time. But those looks rough, he ragdolled Tyron.

    Usman was always very good and entertaining. When he isnt ducking his head and just swinging hes nasty. That pull back counter on Burns was perfect
