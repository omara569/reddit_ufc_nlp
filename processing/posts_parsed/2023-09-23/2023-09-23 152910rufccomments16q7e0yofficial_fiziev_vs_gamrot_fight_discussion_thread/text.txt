    I'm tired of hearing Dominic Cruz, let me enjoy the fights!  Bisbing  deserves to work the main events more, I'd rather listen to him than DC.  Cruz is so boring and annoying to listen to.

    Did anyone else notice Gamrot putting all kinds of pressure and leverage on Fizievs legs during some of the grappling/takedown attempts. He looked like he was mangling his legs and then sure enough the left knee went in the second. It looked fuckin nasty.
