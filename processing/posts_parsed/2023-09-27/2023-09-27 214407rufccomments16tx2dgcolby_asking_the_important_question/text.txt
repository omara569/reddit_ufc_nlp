This is fucking hilarious. Also Ariel had a good point about this. It probably wasn’t Jon that made the call. You put Leon and Colby on 295 and then you have to give PPV points to 2 champions, on a card that is going to sell quite well. You throw in a vacant title fight, now you have 2 championship fights, more people will buy it, and you only have to pay 1 champion.

Regardless of if you are a fan of Colby’s or not, it is admittedly a little wild that one fighter can control whether or not another one even gets on the card…and for a championship fight at that! This is coming from a big Jon Jones fan so it has nothing to do with him personally. Just odd hearing this type of stuff going on since I can’t remember the last time that ever happened.

I think it's more common than you think.  Conor got 3 fighters booted off TUF and replaced with his homies from Ireland.  the recent card in australia was stacked with fighters from City Kickboxing because of adesanya.  Nate notoriously was willing to resign his deal if his buddies got ufc contracts, etc
