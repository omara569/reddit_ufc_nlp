i dont understand why i got downvoted for this take? Prime McGregor was good but he lost to Nate Diaz only a few months before UFC 205 ffs, do you guys seriously think he's a mythical creature or something? Dustin absolutely can beat him

    Are you conveniently forgetting that Dustin got KO'd by Michael Johnson a few months before UFC 205?

    Hot take Connor was never that good. He got in aldos head and threw him off his game. Then beat Eddie imo who also is not great and a perfect matchup for Connor. We saw by his title defences he never wanted any smoke.

    you lost me at "Eddie is not great". if you wanna discredit conor, you should've said he got into Eddies head too

    Yeah idk prime mcgregor was good but 229 against khabib was a much better Mixed Martial Artist than 205, had khabib been champ for 205 he would have subbed him in a round or 2

    Itâ€™s a close one. I think Dustin absolutely could beat 205 McGregor but he was also hurt bad in fight 2 maybe a more active flowy mcgregor gets him out of there.

    I don't get this take when Conor has a win over Dustin.
