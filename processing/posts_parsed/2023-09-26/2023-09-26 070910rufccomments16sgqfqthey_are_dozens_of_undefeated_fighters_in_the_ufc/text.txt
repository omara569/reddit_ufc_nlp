They are dozens of undefeated fighters in the UFC, new ones coming in every month. But how many can remain undefeated after fighting the very top?

    Jones definitely couldnâ€™t.  Losing to Matt hamill like this! Get his elbow broken by his face or smth.

    Dominick Reyes beat Jones. Corrupt judging has protected Jones for too long.
