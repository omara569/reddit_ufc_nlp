He doesn’t know how to compete against a strong wrestler, let alone Khazmat, a 3-time Swedish national champion.Costa is gonna get tossed around all fight.

kinda disagree, Costa has some underrated takedown defence, he is just lazy as fuck. Its either he is on and he is great, or he is overconfident/lazy and just lets everything go to shit. Really inconsistent fighter
