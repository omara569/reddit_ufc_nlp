Who has more potential in the UFC, the Bonfim bros or the Basharat bros?

I don’t know much about the other guys, I’ve only seen the Bonfim bros and the Welterweight one looks very good

Agreed, welterweight's gonna be stacked with exciting fighters soon

Javid and Farid are seriously underrated. I'd say Javid has a higher ceiling than Farid based on his performances. Dude has absolutely picked apart everybody who he's fought in the UFC so far.

For the Bonfim brothers, Gabriel looks really good so far. Mounir Lazzez and Trvein Giles aren't half bad, and Gabriel handled them easily. Ismael is a bit of a gray area. He destroyed McKinney, but St. Denis made him look like an amateur. I'll hold off on an opinion until after the Pichel fight.

It’s honestly crazy that St Denis finished Moises in half the time it took Islam in similar fashion vs an arguably better version of Moises that Islam fought. Guys a fucking terminator. I think Ismael’s loss to St Denis will age very well.

Technically the Bonfims do because they can hypothetically both be ufc champions simultaneously. Basharats both being Bantamweights limits their absolute ceilings. All four of them are high level talents who will be in the top 15 of their divisions imo.

The real question is, which brothers did more pounding behind the barn?

The answer of course being Mark and Matt Hughes
