How quickly do you guys think Khamzat will submit Sean?

has khamzat fought at MW? this fight is not even at middleweight. both those fighters are not even middle weight. ufc is messing things up pushing colby and khamzat as champs. nothing in ufc is natural anymore

Kamzat has a KO win at MW and yes they are fighting at MW with the winner getting the title shot.

Dana hates DDP, he's gonna make him do a real african fight with izzy and then he'll get the shot. Cannonier's getting fucked though, he'll have to wait even longer.

Lol or Cannonier if he wins against Dolidze

iA we get Khamzat vs. Strickland. DDP lowkey missed his chance, let him maul the Gynobender in the meantime.

Poor DDPâ€¦

Seanâ€™s been talking about how much wrestling he does so thatâ€™d be interesting
