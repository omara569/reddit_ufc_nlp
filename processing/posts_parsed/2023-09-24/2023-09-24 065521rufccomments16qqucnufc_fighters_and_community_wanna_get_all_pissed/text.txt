UFC Fighters and Community wanna get all pissed at Gamrot after he celebrates an injury TKO win,but when Dustin did it no one batted an eye and gave a shit?!
You people switch up way too damn much. Most of the people didn‚Äôt care that Dustin celebrated it mainly due to their hate of Conor but it still doesn‚Äôt justify it either way ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

    FFS like 2-5 sec after breaking, being high on adrenaline. Justified. He didn't talk shit while interview, wished him fast recovery.

    I‚Äôve got no issue with either. This sport is a war of attrition and one persons body is going to break down before the other, the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù is just semantics

    Think about the absolute relief that you would feel knowing the fight has ended and  you‚Äôre ok.  These guys are dangerous as fuck and these fights are probably the lost stressful situation a person could be in.  It would be a huge and surprising relief to see the other guy randomly go down like that, and also knowing you get a win bonus too.
  
    I feel like it is cause for some celebration, when you‚Äôre in there and the name of the game is to not get as damaged as the other guy.   As long as they are humble afterwards when the dust has settled and they show respect to be injured party I think it‚Äôs ok.
  
    Conor definitely didn‚Äôt deserve any respect though.

    It's funny how we consider people's chins to be part of what makes a good fighter but we don't consider other vulnerabilities. Theres probably some flash ko's that have happened that had a lower chance of happening then someobody breaking their leg on a kick. Durability is part of the sport. If youre gonna act like it isn't you might as well only count hard knockouts and not count any knockouts on people with glass jaws. Why do we make an excuse for when someone legs are weak but not when their chin is? It's body durability either way. Training right, conditioning, recovery are all apart of being a fighter. So even if you win a fight by simply having a more durable body than your opponent, that still took preparation, that still took hard work, so who fucking cares. It's part of the game. Fighting doesn't have the luxury of being based 100% on skill.

    Conor talked SO much shit about dustin, dustin‚Äôs wife etc - it‚Äôs literally understandable why dustin did it, he had a motive behind his celebration lol
  
    This is a such a  stupid comparison. Like respectfully, this is stupid

    Couple differences here, Dustin kicked conors leg a bunch and checked well, so he is sorta responsible for the injury and he was also beating conor. Fizzy however just twisted his knee while throwing a kick, gamrot had nothing to do with that, also Fizzy was winning which makes it feel less like Gamrot earned the win.

    There's a difference between the two, Dustin broke Connors leg, while Fiziev broke his knee by himself.

    And Dustin was winning, Gamrot wasn‚Äôt. Conor is a POS, Fiziev isn‚Äôt.
  
    It‚Äôs pretty obvious why these situations are vastly different.
  
    Edit: plus Dustin still got shit for it anyway. this post is pointless mao
