JR lost his shit a little when Francis confirmed he’d be up for it.Francis Ngannou said (on JRE) he and the PFL would be open to a Jon Jones fight in the UFC. Would the UFC let this happen? And who you got winning?

    WEC and UFC did some weird PPV where it was WEC but they scrubbed the name WEC off the gloves and canvas and kept callling it ‘The Company’ but it had Matt and Joe as announcers like a UFC one, it was bizarre but it would be funny if UFC did that with PFL

    Why would that happen? That benefits PFL massively, but not so much for the UFC.

    This.
  
    It benefits the fans, it benefits the sport,and benefits the PFL.
  
    But it doesn’t benefit the UFC so it’s unfortunately not going to happen

    Absolutely no chance whatsoever would the ufc even consider ever co-promoting with another organisation/promotion. Nothing to gain for them, everything to gain for the co-promoter.

    Exactly, what if the PFL champion leaves with the UFC belt? That's horrible for business!! If the UFC champ leaves with the PFL belt, it wouldn't mean much either way because it's a lesser known promotion in the general public.  If anything PFL would get a ton of exposure lol.

    Dana and UFC wouldnt let this happen. same reason Fedor and M-1 Global never cross promoted with the UFC. Jones has a better chance fighting out his 8 fight contract then going over to PFL...

    Hear me out. Ufc cant make izzy vs chimaev for ufc 300. Conor may never return. Islam could still beat oliveira and volk will likely not be able to turnaround from january against topuria to april against makhachev. O malley chito is not strong enough to headline 300 and neither is any 205 fight. If jon jones beats stipe dominantly he has said ngannou is the only fight for him and so he could retire. Jones vs Ngannou is one of the few fights that can headline 300

    Would like that but can’t see a world where Dana would now agree to having it happen
