Its crazy that Islam doesn't even respect Charles ground game

    He did a little bit perhaps, went for upper body takedowns only.

    Why would he? He's been wrestling since he was like Hasbulla size.

    He wasn’t doing anything on the ground until he rocked Charles, I still think he’s underestimating Charles ground game and if he goes to the ground with him in the middle of the octagon it might be harder than he thinks to finish him

    Well the fighter with the most submission wins in the UFC also didn't do jack shit to Islam on the ground either other than threaten some submission  which Islam defended really well.
  
    Oliveira lost round 1 convincingly
  
    Also why do you think Islam will look for finishing Charles on the ground in round 1 ? Islam can easily make Oliveira carry his weight, make him tired and then outbox him during standup. I mean, it's not like Islam wasn't dogwalking a fresh Oliveira in striking
  
    Oliveira struggles against southpaws and Islam is one of the best counter strikers at LW and also a southpaw
