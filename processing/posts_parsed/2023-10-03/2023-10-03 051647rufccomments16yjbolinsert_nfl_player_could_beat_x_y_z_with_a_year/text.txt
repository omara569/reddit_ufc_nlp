That was post NFL Hardy. If Arthur* or Chandler Jones decided to follow Jon into MMA, I think they could be solid contenders. NFL and NBA pay better than UFC, so most top-tier athletes either stay or come into MMA after they're done with their first sport.

Edit: Chris Jones is not related to Jon Jones. Arthur Jones is.

Chris jones is unrelated, but as a chiefs fan, heâ€™d still be a beast

I mean tbf he did win 4 fights in the premier mma organization. 99.9999% of people could not do that.

NBA players would be more interesting, length and cardio. Imagine Russell Westbrook throwing a flying knee

Nick Bosa would demolish Moreno at this very moment

NFL players would just be heavyweights that gas out 2 minutes into the first round out and have mud slinging fights for the next 13...



People just overestimate them just based on their appearance.

Yea NFL players train for explosiveness. Their cardio would be absolute shit.

Micah Parsons used to wrestle in high school and trains both boxing and jiu-jitsu regularly. He's in a league of athletic freaks and looks like a high schooler playing with middle schoolers most of the time, so I'm willing to bet he'd do pretty good at MMA. He's 250lbs and 6'3". I'd put him top five at heavyweight with a year of full time training.
