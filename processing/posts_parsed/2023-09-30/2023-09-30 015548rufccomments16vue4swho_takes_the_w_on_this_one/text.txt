Max, his take down defense is seriously underrated.

He is also a massive FW

I would want to see this fight for the vacant belt once Volk retires or moves up to lightweight permanently (if he beats Ilia) but I can see Max winning by unanimous decision

U think Sean is accurate with 1 punch? Max is accurate with 10 punches

Holloway is a great boxer but certainly isn't known for his power. It took O'Malley 6 shots to win a title. Holloway lands hundreds and just broke his world record decision streak.

Is this a joke. Aljo doesnâ€™t survive 2

Aljo might surprise some people
