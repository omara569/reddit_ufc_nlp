About izzy's Dui
I aint a izzy fan, hes weird for the dog shit. But cmon? Giving him shit? My guy had maybe 3 or 4 beers max. He was .07 mg above the limit of .80 mg. I know nothing of NZ laws or culture but i would assume this is kinda assinine?

    This is nowhere near comparable to what jon did besides alcohol and driving being involved imo
  
    Dont drink and drive either, not worth it.

    JBJ is def the all timer when it comes to DUIs out of the cage. Izzy at best is JV squad. Agree not worth drinking and driving.

    So he was barely above the legal limit, yes. Still, above the legal limit. Though, just because you are technically around the "legal limit" doesn't mean you aren't driving dangerously. He got pulled over, yeah? I mean something must've given away his intoxication, no?

    Not sure about NZ laws but I live in Australia and the police here can pull you over just to do breathalyser test. They don’t have to have a reason for a stop like the US

    For anyone interested the sentence in NZ for a first DUI is usually 6 months loss of license and court fees of $600. He will get a conviction (unless he can pull some sort of celebrity strings) so unsure what they will mean for getting into the US?

    Nah he won't. He will take some sort of deal where he has to do a bunch of talks a out how drink driving is bad and avoid anything.

    Yea, he obviously wasn’t driving around wasted. I don’t think he deserves to get crucified over it.
