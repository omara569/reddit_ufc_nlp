UFC Fighters and Community wanna get all pissed at Gamrot after he celebrates an injury TKO win,but when Dustin did it no one batted an eye and gave a shit?!
You people switch up way too damn much. Most of the people didn’t care that Dustin celebrated it mainly due to their hate of Conor but it still doesn’t justify it either way 🤷‍♂️
