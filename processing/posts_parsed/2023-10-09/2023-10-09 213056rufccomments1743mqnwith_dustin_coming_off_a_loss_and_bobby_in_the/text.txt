With Dustin coming off a loss and Bobby in the top 10, is this the fight to make?

    Dustin has already KOed Green.
  
    Also both Green and Hooker have already agreed to fight.
  
    Only option left for Porier is Gamrot even though they are team mates.

    Poirier also got KO’ed two months ago so there’s a good chance he just waits to heal and gets Oliveira or a Gaethje rematch next

    I'd prefer Bobby's next fight to be Hooker or Turner. Maybe even RDA if he's sticking around at 155.

    Bobby doesn't deserve to be in there with Dustin. No way, sorry he still isn't at that level. He beat a very washed up tony and whoever this new guy was but still not that impressive

    whoever this new guy was
  

    Just say you don't follow MMA.
  
    Dawson is/was one of the best looking prospects at LW. Undefeated in the UFC with some solid names under his belt like Erosa, Minner, Madsen, and basically retired Ismagulov who everyone thought was the next contender.
  
    He was ranked #10 for a reason.

    Wish Fiziev didn’t get injured, would love to see him fight Dustin. That fight, Gamrot, or even a Hooker rematch all make more sense to me than this fight would. Even though Dustin’s coming off a loss and Bobby a win, still feel like this is a “there’s levels to this” matchup
