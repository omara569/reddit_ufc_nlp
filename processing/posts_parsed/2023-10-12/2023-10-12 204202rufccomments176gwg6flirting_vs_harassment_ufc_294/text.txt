    Well unlike Paulo, Charles wasn't doing unfunny  trash-talking on twitter when he knew he wouldn't be ready/fit to fight.
  
    Unfortunately Paulo is turning to into a Dillon Danis

    Dana white himself said in an interview the doctors will probably clear him but the doctors didn't in the end, UFC can't let uncleared fighters fight.
  
    Idk what is the deal here. He didn't get that infection on purpose, other atheletes with it didn't have anything nice to say.

    Costa fights once a year at best and doesn't have a win over an active middleweight...he is funny af on twitter or whatever that shit is these days, but fucking hell he needs to get active and fight someone, like fucking anyone at this stage, or just give up and be a twitter troll and model or some shit.
