Going insane? This is probably the most coherent tweet by Costa ever

Dude is doing everything to hold onto that paycheck. I don‚Äôt blame him, especially if this was his one big payday for the year.

It's better he doesn't fight. His body is probably weaker after being on antibiotics and other meds for so long and only training with one arm. He'll get his chance to prove himself once he 100% again.

Cardio is absolutely trashed on antibiotics. Or it was for me.

I think a big issue with Costa is his Twitter is normally filled with him talking shit, posting memes and being goofy.

The problem is when he‚Äôs actually being serious and genuine (if he is) no one is actually going to believe him.
