Anyone have an idea on what DC was lecturing Joe & Anik on here?

    “No, a popeyes biscuit is NOT dry. You have to understand, listen to me, guys, you go when they are fresh. I showed Khabib this trick and he comes back to me and says DC, brother, why you keep this secret to yourself? I tell him brother, I can’t have you at my popeyes locations taking my fresh biscuits.”

    Nah. It’s just the pre-event spelling bee they always do.
