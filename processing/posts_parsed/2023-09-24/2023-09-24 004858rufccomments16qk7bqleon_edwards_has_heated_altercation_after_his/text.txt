    Johnny Eblen better watch out man, if he keeps up Leon will try to kick his ass 9 months from now.

    Eblen (pretended to?) Spit on Leon's brother standing over him post ko which was from brutal gnp elbows. I'd probably be a bit pissed too if I was Leon, douchebag movie on Eblen's part.

    Eblen is masvidals teammate. I wonder if it's to do with that
