Jon Jones has some of the meanest and coldest trash talks in the whole UFC

    I think JJ held back a smile after DC said, "Do you think I'm gona sit there and let you kill me?"

    Irrespective pf how you feel about JJ, you gotta admit that it was beyond impressive to see JJ not let DC take him down. Mind that DC is one of the most accomplished wrestlers in the UFC.

    DC is easily top 3 best wrestlers in the entire UFC history, only Bones and Khabib(even this is debatable) top him. The man threw around a 260lbs Stipe like a sack of potatoes. People don’t credit DC because of his humiliating losses to Bones and Stipe but DC in his prime was the man. Nobody in LHW history could’ve beaten a prime DC except Bones

    I think Jones would have literally murdered Adesanya. Good lord he would do him bad.

    Imagine if Jon Jones fully embraced the villain role

    Gotta remember it's a villain ROLE.
  
    Dude's a method actor. Started beating his wife and driving drunk. Pure commitment to the role.

    After JJ choked out Machido holding up his limp unconcious corpse until the ref finally realised he was out cold and had been for some time:
  
    DC; “and did you realise that he was out!?” JJ; awkward pause “ugh yeh.  I realised he was out, after a while….anyway, just wanna thank my team…”
  
    By far his scariest line ever imo.
