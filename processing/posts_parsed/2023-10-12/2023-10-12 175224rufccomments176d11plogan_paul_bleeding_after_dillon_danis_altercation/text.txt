This was Dillionâ€™s plan all along. Have Logan Paul pull out instead 500 IQ

Logan started it, and Dillon is Dillon.  What did he expect would happen.

LMFAO, Dillon has won every aspect of this build up. Unbelievable.

Logan started this shit but I bet heâ€™s gonna try to charge or sue Dillion over this. Dude has zero integrity.

Dude shouldnâ€™t have thrown a mic at Dillions dick but mic to the head is crazy knowing youâ€™re gonna be boxing ðŸ˜‚ both are fucking retards like why bruh.

Logan Paul does. Mike Perry will do bad things with Dillon Danis.
