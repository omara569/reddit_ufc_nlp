That Brock fight was wild, shame he blew his load, but man he was beating the fuck out of Brock, like that whole invincibility thing with Brock was gone after this, but props for coming back and winning, sucks there was never a rematch but I would Imagine Brock didn‚Äôt want to run that back.

He blew his load üíÄ but nah carwin had that shit in the bag you could say it should've been stopped to.

Imagine if he trained full time back then. He was working full time as an engineer and trained maybe an hour or two a day and still KO‚Äôd everyone.

That Brock fight should've been stopped lol look at the ref he could give a fuck less and is so far away cuz dana prolly told him to only stop the fight if Brock goes to sleep

I still can't believe Brock didn't go to sleep. Carwin has that death touch.

Met this dude at one of the Bud Light after parties one year, and he was so massive. I'm not a small guy at 6'2", about 200 lbs, and I felt like I was a dwarf. Crazy.
