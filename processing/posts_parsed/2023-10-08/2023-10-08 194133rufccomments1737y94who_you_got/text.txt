    With the upsets we've had this year I'm not betting on anyone.

    I think Walker is a layup for Ank.
  
    I don't see Charles giving Islam any new challenges in this fight, but we've all learned you can't count him out.
  
    My gut tells me Khamzat will take Paulo down in the first 30 seconds with ease and choke him out. I can't see KC trying to stand with Paulo for 3 rounds.
