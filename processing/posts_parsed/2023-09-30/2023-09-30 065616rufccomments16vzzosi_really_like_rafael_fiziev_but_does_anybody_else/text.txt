I really like Rafael Fiziev, but does anybody else feel like he is kinda pillowfisted? he couldn't KO Bobby Green, Marc Diakese or Alex White, and his only KO's with his hands in the UFC are an early stoppage vs chinny Renato Moicano & old washed post-iv ban RDA

You pointed out 5 fights, in which he gets 2 finishes, so clearly he has power in his hands. I assume you're just baiting.

He's too small for the division tbh.  I think his frame is more suited for 145.

Everyone gets fucked by Justin. If he would have beat Justin he would have had a title shot. Dude is okay at 155
