Costa has a good chance in a 3 rounder.

I don't think this sub is ready for the Paulo and Khamzat fight. You see constantly see the excuses for Khamzat's inability to wrangle Burns, but Costa is 10 times the size of Burns. I truly believe the Khamzat won't win this fight and if he does, it'll be by a slim margin.

I'm not sure what sub you're reading,  but I get down voted for pointing out that Burns is levels and levels above anyone at MW when it comes to BJJ. People are all over Costa on here.
