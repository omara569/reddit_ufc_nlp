No why, there’s literally nobody else for volk to fight if that happens. Volk and topuria both want this fight, for volk this would cement his FW legacy and for topuria a title shot.

Agreed, no more letting Max get first shot at title contenders

If anything, let Max get Volk's sloppy seconds to see if Ilia (or anyone else) can earn a rematch

As if Volk doesn’t have every intention to show up in January despite recent turn of events.
