    DC.
  
    People clown on him for the video of him crying, and I get he's not everyone's favourite on the commentary team, but he seems like a real solid dude. Seems like the kinda guy most people would be lucky to have as a friend.

    Never understood the hate he receives and the type of people who clown him for crying are scum.

    Anderson Silva. No one was as impressive in victory as he was in his prime, and he ducked no one.

    Erin Blanchfield because she's badass in the octagon while conducting herself with quiet confidence outside of it. No bullshit, just violence.
