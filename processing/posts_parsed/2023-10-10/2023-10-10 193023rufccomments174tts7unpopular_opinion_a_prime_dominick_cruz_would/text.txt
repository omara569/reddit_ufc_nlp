    That's not a hot take, I'm pretty sure most of us agree with that statement.

    You state it’s an unpopular opinion, without even canvassing if it actually is an unpopular opinion. So how do you know it is indeed an unpopular opinion?

    Dominkck wouldnt be top 3 tbh. He doesnt beat Cejudo,Merab or Aljo. May be a good match for O'Malley though. Would have lived to see prime Dom fight prime Petr.

    cruz has always done better against short, stocky swingers. i think cruz would have a field day against aljo. i don’t see aljo touching cruz at all and getting picked apart. i doubt he could manage to takedown or wrestle cruz either. i think the exact same with merab, although cejudo would be a harder fight. i actually think omalley is one of the harder fights for his style in the division but i think he could put wrestle sean.

    Popular opinion: posts that say "unpopular opinion" then don't give an unpopular opinion, are annoying

    Nah, he ducks into a head kick sooner

    why because he got clipped with one headkick half a decade after his prime
