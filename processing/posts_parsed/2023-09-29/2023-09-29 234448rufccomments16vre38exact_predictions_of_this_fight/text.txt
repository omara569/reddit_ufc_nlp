This is a tough one, it’s going to be hard to watch. I’m a huge Oliveira fan, but I’m really skeptical of his chances and definitely don’t want to see a repeat of the first fight. Hopefully it plays out a bit differently even if he doesn’t get the win.

Interesting… I predict that Islam gets an incredible dominant victory against Charles that leads this sub to discuss for months that he is the LW GOAT and then for Islam’s next defense he gets brutally flatlined in Round 1 via fluke front flip headkick by Chandler who was gifted a title shot cause Dana felt bad that Conor ghosted him

Charles has a lightning in his pocket, and Islam's chin has proven to be pretty rockable.

Thing is, looking at the Beneil fight, it's gonna be pretty hard for Charles to get escape Islam's ground game. And I'm pretty damn skeptical Charles could pull out a sub, these Dagestan dudes style and strength makes it almost impossible for them to get subed.

So, Charles way of winning is literally by his usual means; rocking the shit out of the opponent with a precise blow.

Safe money is Islam by decision.
