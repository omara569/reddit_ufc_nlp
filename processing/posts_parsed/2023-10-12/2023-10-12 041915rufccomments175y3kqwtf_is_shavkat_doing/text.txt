    To give context: It is currently Khesenjoon in Khazakstan which is similar to the western tradition of Halloween, he is giving the childrens gifts of candy in order to get strength and aid from his god. This is a common practise at this time in Khazakstan.

    Might be his little sister or his niece or something. Nobody seems worried about it and there is an adult with the children who doesnâ€™t seem fazed so I donâ€™t see no issues.
