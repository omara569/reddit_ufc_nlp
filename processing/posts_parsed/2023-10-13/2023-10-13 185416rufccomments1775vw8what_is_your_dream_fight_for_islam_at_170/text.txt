Leon v Islam, they actually trained at AKA once and before Islam entered the cage Javier told Islam "watch out for his left high kick"... ðŸ˜‚

But the Colby Trash talk tho, would be something else. It will be a gigantic fight

He's moved up permanently I think, look at how big he is now compared to his early UFC fights. He can prob still make it if he had to but it's gonna take like 4-5 months and why do it, he seems to be having fun not cutting as much weight.
