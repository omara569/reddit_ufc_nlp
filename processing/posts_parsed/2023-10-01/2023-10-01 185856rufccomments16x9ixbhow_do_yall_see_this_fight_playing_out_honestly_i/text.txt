How do y’all see this fight playing out honestly I can see khamzat taking costa down but I don’t think he’ll keep him down for long plus if it’s on the feet I can see costa piecing him up and throwing a lot of body kicks

    Honestly, the more ripped and shredded and big Khamzat looks, the more I think Costa is gonna win.
  
    Stylistically, Khamzat should win this 9 times outa 10, but it’s MIDDLEWEIGHT - so I just have this aching suspicion that the Meme Fighter will win the fight just like Dricus v Whittaker / Strickland v DEZANYA
  
    That weightclass has a type meme magic that is poorly understood

    It’s just gonna be interesting to see how khamzats game translates against giant MWs, Costa is an easy 30 plus maybe more pounds heavier than Gilbert burns and even Kevin Holland

    I predict Costa will come in at around 214 like he did against Yoel in order to have it easier with the wrestling.
  
    Khamzat on the other hand will be 205 max on fight day.
  
    I don’t think Costa will have gas for more than 1.5 rounds against Khamzat coming in that heavy so if (and that’s a giant IF) he can defend the take downs early he’ll definitely be worn down in the second.
  
    I see Khamzat just overwhelming him and I don’t think the weight difference will be as massive as people say. Khamzat is bigger than he looks because he has the same lanky build as Izzy.

    I don’t think Costa is intimidated by him at all and will look to turn it into a fire fight if khamzat can’t resist who knows tbh

    If khamzat gets suckered into a brawl I don't like his odds. He got his with a lot of counters by burns when he was mid combo trying to go for a finish.
  
    Fighting at the heavier weight might also mean he gasses quicker than he did as he's using more energy to grapple with bigger opponents.
  
    Only way I see a Costa win is a flash knockout, anything else surely favours khamzat.
  
    In conclusion: Costa to miss weight by 60lbs.

    This fight is gonna disappoint a lot of people. Khamzat is taking this dude down at will and choking him in 1.

    I was watching the  costa Luke fight. In the third costa basically bench pressed Luke off him with one hand

    Dude seems freaky strong and athletic. Yoel shot for a td, got it and it was like costa just reversed him mid air and was standing again.
