And somehow I still have more faith in Stipe pulling it off.

Stipe’s nearly three inactivity comes into question, but Jon had the same amount of being inactive too coming up to HW. I think this fight will be more competitive than people predict.

It’s all in what he’s been up to in those 3 years. Will be an interesting fight to say the least.

Stipe is a good wrestler, why would he be afraid of a guy who struggled with Reyes?

Stipe at the very least is one of the greatest heavyweights of all time, Colby peaked at an interim championship and 2 title fight losses.

Objectively speaking I can’t see why anyone would have more faith in Stipe. We’ve seen him lose to DC and Ngannou (both Jones beat by UD, TKO, and wimp out of the company). Jones at Hw had shown no flaws and Stipe has been off 3 years.

Colby on the other hand has shown incredible skill against literally everyone he has ever faced and has supreme cardio. He did as well against Usman as Leon did. (4 rounds won vs Usman out of 10, vs 7 out of 15 Leon won vs Usman that’s about equal). He’s coming off a lot less a layoff, in fact he’s going to be very fresh. Idk I think Colby is Leon is more of a coin flip where Jones Vs Stipe is looking much more lopsided.
