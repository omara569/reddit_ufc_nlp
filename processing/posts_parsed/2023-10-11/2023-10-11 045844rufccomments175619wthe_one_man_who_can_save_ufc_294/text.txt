Winner gets Strickland, Usman already beat Strickland before and Khamzat needs a fight. Usman is higher on the P4P than Sean and Izzy. Khamzat would deserve a title shot if he beats him, he would deserve a Shot if he beats Khamzat.The one man who can Save UFC 294

    Usman can definitely step in, he’s been in the gym & he’s ready to go. 185 or 170 doesn’t matter. 185 might be better on short notice, he’s walking around 200 right now.

    I don’t want to see Khamzat fight Dolidze or Vettori and definitely not Ikram again, either this or Put Khamzat Vs. Paulo on UFC 295

    He’d be fighting one of the best contenders in years as his comeback fight from horrific losses in Leon. 3 losses in a row is a really bad thing for him especially money wise, so I think he would want more than just a week to prepare for a fight like that unfortunately
