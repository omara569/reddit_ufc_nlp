    But you don't take into account the circumstances.Sean is basically in his prime and even tho he got KO'd before, he didn't take that much damage in his whole career overall. Statistically he is the most defensive fighter in the MW division. You also don't take into account their ages.Stipe is not 30, 35, 37, 40 years old, he is fuckin 41 years old!!!And don't compare Izzy to Jon, come on now.
