Itâ€™s an interesting move I donâ€™t think anyone besides volk expected. Accepting a 10 day notice super fight pfp 1 title rematch, after recent surgery? Itâ€™s not like volk is broke, or heâ€™s feeling like his prime is slipping away ( he dominated Yair)        I think itâ€™s pretty obvious that volk is coming in 10 days to destroy and win, because he believe it. I mean look at the fist fight how can he not?        I think this fight is gunna be a fucking war im so excited for this rematch even more that itâ€™s short noticeYou have to question Volks motivation for doing this

    Volk did not get where he is by doubting himself. I recall similar discussions just before the first Islam fight - more than the skills and athleticism, he has the confidence and the mindset to pull this off, and gave Islam the toughest fight of his career aside from the one where he got KO'd.
  
    I still lean to Islam winning but there are only 2 fighters that can realistically dethrone him, and one just pulled out of the fight. The other one knows when to rise up to the challenge.

    Time. Volks 35 has a few good years left before his body starts to wear down.

    I know he just had surgery and all, but itâ€™s kind of a nice spot to be inâ€¦ itâ€™s all upsides for him: the potential to get revenge on an absolute monster from a higher weight class, becoming one of the few double champs in UFC historyâ€¦. If he loses heâ€™s still the p4p best and champion of the featherweight division, and shows that heâ€™s willing to go anytime, any place. Even if he loses, It only adds more grit and character to his legendary careerâ€¦ I didnâ€™t really want the fight like this, but if he pulls this off? Fuckin hell, heâ€™s going to put himself in the goat conversation when people toss around names like GSP, Silva and jones
