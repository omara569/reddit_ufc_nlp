Someone has to call out bisping for literally making excuses for adesanyas drunk driving, and it aint gonna be anyone from the UFC. I don't see the problem

izzy provided a BAC of 0.087.... which is insane because the test usually happens hours after being pulled over, and most likely hours after he started drinking. Izzy is not a small man by any means, at 90 kg or more. He most likely had 6-8 drinks and drove, which has no justification no matter how much izzy fans want to spin it. His fans and Izzy himself want everyone to believe that he just downed a couple of beers and began driving, which is still bad, but omits the true nature and severity of his crime

I'm not saying drink driving is right (it's clearly wrong) but people are acting like its a way more serious offence than it is.

People are behaving like a drink driver is as bad being a rapist or a murderer.

Calm down. Let him take his medicine. People make mistakes.

i don't like izzy. i just think it's funny that guru will take every opportunity to sap as many views as he can from this.
