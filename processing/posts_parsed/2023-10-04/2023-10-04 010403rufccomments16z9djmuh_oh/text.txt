Sean honestly seems the most mentally stable/happy i've ever seen him. The only time i felt he was really in a dark place/gonna do something horrific was during first ariel interview/flex lewis interview, as someone who is just as bad as Sean mentally, I could tell something was up and was worried for him. Gotta really give it to Flex and his coach for being absolute stand up guys, it takes a lot to be vulnerable like that and they definitely helped him a lot through it all. I really hope the best for Sean
