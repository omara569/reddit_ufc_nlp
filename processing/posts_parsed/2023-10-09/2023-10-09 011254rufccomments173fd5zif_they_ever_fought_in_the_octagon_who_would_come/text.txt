If they ever fought in the octagon, who would come out victorious?

    Khabib in my opinion. Islam even said Khabib beats him every time during their training today. So imagine if they would have fought when Khabib was fighting. Granted, Iâ€™m sure their training is tough, but it is not the same as getting punched in the face at 100% strength by another person. I believe Khabib would have been even more ready with reaction time than he might be currently.  Khabibâ€™s hands were not refined early in his career, but toward the end he proved to be pretty damn good on the feet, knocking Connor on his ass. Islam on the other hand has better striking, but not enough to overwhelmingly outclass Khabib.

    Khabib probably has 15kg on him now

    I don't put much stock into Islam's words on that because khabib is older so he's probably being deferential to him.

    Khabib
  
    Just a more dangerous man
  
    He doesnâ€™t just want to win
  
    He needs to absolute dominate every opponent

    Islams the better striker, but I think fight iq and overall grappling goes to khabib. Khabib wins I think, likely by a rathar uneventful decision

    Islam is technically better but khabib has an unbeatable will, and is more savage.

    Surprised nobody mentioned the super muscle fibers on Makhachevâ€™s back, and that surely a sign heâ€™d win in that fight ðŸ˜‚
