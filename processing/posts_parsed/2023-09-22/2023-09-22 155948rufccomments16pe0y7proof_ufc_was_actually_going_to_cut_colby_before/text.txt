    All you have to do is see guys cut off one loss or getting iced by match makers. Theadoru got cut of a split decision to Brunson despite coming off a winning streak

    I think the heel turn was outing Dana in the Vegas Casino

    I’d argue that’s more of a face turn

    The proof? His manager talking about it. Pretty weak imo. This is not really the definitive proof you seem to think it is

    His ex manager AND the owner of American Tap Team where Jorge masdival trains. Mind you this was AFTER colby was kicked from american top team.

    When was the last time a top 5 guy got cut for being boring, especially one on a 5 fight win streak. He was talking shit before the Maia fight as well. Its just another lie to get people to sympathize

    This post is for the nerds and virgins that constantly claim Colby made up the story about being cut from the UFC as an excuse to turn heel. This is from an interview with Dan Lambert and ESPN before Colby vs Masdvial fight. Dan Lambert was the former manager of Colby Covington and owner of American Tap Team in Coconut Creek Florida.
