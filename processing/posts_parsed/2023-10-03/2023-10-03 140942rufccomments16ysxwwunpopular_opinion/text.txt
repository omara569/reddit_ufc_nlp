    These straw men arguments are pointless. The sub has millions of people it's probably different people who are defending Jon and bashing this guy

    I don't think he should be in the UFC.
  
    Not because he's a dickhead as loads of fighters are dickheads.
  
    But because he has one eye and shouldn't pass medical exams that for example Bisping used to have to cheat and lie his way through.
  
    There's medical rules in place for a reason.

    FYI, I donâ€™t agree or approve of anything they have done, I just think that you shouldnâ€™t be held to a more lenient standard based on your resume and popularity.
