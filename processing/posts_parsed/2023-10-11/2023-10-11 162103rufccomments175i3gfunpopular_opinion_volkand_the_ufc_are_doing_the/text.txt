There's two main reasons why I think this:        if he gets beat badly he's potentially shutting the door on a proper(full camp) rematch for a long time or potentially ever. I say potentially ever because with islam increasingly looking at welterweight and seemingly heading the khabib route of not planning to have a long career, that combined with the fact that after seeing this, nobodys going to want to see the rematch for bare minimum another year, at which case God knows if islam will still even care about it(especially with islams "don't use it as an excuse" comment, kinda seems like islams done with the volk saga if volk loses)        he's also robbing another new contender of a title shot, which lightweight is desperately needing. Even if islam destroyed gamrot, it would atleast help the divison move a bit more.        I know these are more the ufcs fault for offering than volks fault for excepting, but it just seems like the fans are almost certainly losing out on a proper rematch now (I dont care how much the ufc wants to give another real shot to volk after this, if islam doesn't want to fight him, he won't, it's that simple) and losing out seeing fresh blood in a lightweight title fight for the first time since islam him self challenged for the beltUnpopular opinion: volk(and the ufc) are doing the fans a disservice by taking this fight (read body)

    I wanted to see the rematch, but after a full camp, not after a 10 days camp. I don't think I'll see the best version of Volkswagen.

    Yeah exactly what I'm getting at. And it seems like with islams comments that he has no interest in another match after this. So it just unfortunate, seems like a dumb rushed decision by the ufc. But, I guess they have pressure from the Saudis.

    I care more about volk fighting Islam than gamrot getting it but I feel for him

    I don’t think a proper rematch was very likely tbh

    Understand where you’re coming from but Volk just saved the card. Don’t think it’s fair to say he’s doing anyone a disservice.
  
    And unfortunately with losing Costa too Gamrot is just not a big enough name to square the card away. And not to dig into the guy but he doesn’t really deserve a shot yet nor do I think he’d bring a competitive fight. I feel bad the UFC blue balled him on this one but he never should’ve been the guy to begin with.

    Gamrot asked for Charles in his post fight, and will now likely get Charles.
  
    If he manages to pull off that win he will be a much bigger draw for a title shot rather than coming off an injury win against Fiziev.
