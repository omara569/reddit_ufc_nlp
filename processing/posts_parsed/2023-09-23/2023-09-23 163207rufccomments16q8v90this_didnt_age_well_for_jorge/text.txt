    Maybe the UFC is rewarding Colby for keeping a low profile all this time and not letting this blow up / drag all over the news while the merging was happening.  It's bad for business when UFC fighters do stupid shit outside of the octagon.

    He definitely kept surprisingly quiet on that whole thing, i wouldn't be surprised if that's part of why he got to keep his title shot despite being out for so long. Definitely not how things normally go in the UFC

    UFC is rewarding colby because they need him on the new contract same as they needed Cejudo, while still using some of the fanbase and publicity they have left for them until new contenders with fanbases emerge

    Has the court case been concluded yet? If not I would argue this might have aged extremely well for Jorge. Colby getting sanctioned to fight would likely reflect poorly on any claims that he received a brain injury from Masvidalâ€™s attack.

    A concussion is a form of brain injury. Itâ€™s an extremely broad term.

    I hate masvidal. Colby is a tool and a clown with his lame schtick but george brags about sucker punching multiple people. He deserves to spend some time in jail
