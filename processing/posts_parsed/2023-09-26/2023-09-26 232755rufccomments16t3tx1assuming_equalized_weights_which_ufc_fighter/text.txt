Assuming equalized weights, which UFC fighter would have the best chance against Roy Jones Jr. in a pure boxing match?

    In his prime? No one.

    Zero… none. You are talking about one of the most gifted boxers ever.

    None, none in that none who have ever fought in a cage would even stand a chance in Roy’s prime. Hell, you could give them 20lb weight advantage and he’d still have his way. Roy Jones is arguably the most talented fighter to have ever lived, not records, not title fights, just raw skill, power and speed. He was the top of each one.
