Based on DC's INSIDER info he said the new co main will drop ur jaw and be bigger than the current card... and it's likely one of these 2. No way UFC is gonna end khamzats streak so soon...

    Izzy would be my pick since Volk is on the card.

    This.. It doesn't make sense for Borz who was in a title eliminator to fight Usman where is nothing on the line.. It has to be Israel Adesanya who wants to redeem himself

    I would love to see low blow bo getting ragdolled by Khamzats "trash" wrestling lmao
  
    Imagine your first fight against a non-can and it's Borz on short notice lol. Bo would never agree.

    Burns posted a video of Usman hitting the pads this morning. I think this is Usman's best chance to get a title shot at 185

    Neither guy needs to do this, nor should want to.
  
    Usman is a 170 fighter(This short notice, I don’t see Khamzat cutting to 170, and I sure as hell don’t see Usman fighting at 185).
  
    Izzy is someone who’s set to get the rematch whether people like it or not, so why would he do this?

    Actually I'm not so sure about the rematch thing, Israel got a lot of push-back from the media when a rematch was mentioned and in all fairness he did lose the belt with 0 defences this time.
  

    Plus I think Israel vs Chimaev would be a banger.

    Only way my jaw gets dropped is if it's Shavkat, Bo, or Strickland lol
