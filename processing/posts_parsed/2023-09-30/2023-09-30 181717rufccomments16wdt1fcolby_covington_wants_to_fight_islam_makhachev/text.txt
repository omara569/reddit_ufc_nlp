    Yeah Islam is so scared of the "real man" who in his prime got taken down 3 times by an undersized past his prime RDA at WW and gassed hard in that fight and won only by 48-47
  
    What's Colby gonna do ? outbox makachev or ragdoll him ? Both aint happening. Makachev has faced much better fighters than Colby's opponents and most importantly won the fight.
  
    The only funny thing about Colby is that even after all this shit talk he ain't a PPV star. Imagine making fun of your opponent's dead former coach and you still ain't a drawðŸ˜‚
  
    Colbys talks trash like he doesn't even believe what he says. Reeks of desperation

    Itâ€™s always funny to me when people forget the RDA fight. RDA was hugely undersized and still almost beat Colby.
  
    The win aged horribly too after Leon and Kamaru beat RDA in one sided fights. Even Chiesa beat him.

    Colby is barely cutting any weight. I don't think Islam would be in disadvantage regarding the size and weight

    You should take that up with IcyArmour and Higgsboson at the top of the thread claiming RDA was "hUgElY uNdErSizEd" against the gigantic WW that is Colby Covington.

    Colby is just building the fight.  And honestly if somehow Islam beats Charles again and Colby beats Leon, this would be an exciting fight and build up.  Islam low key likes to talk shit too.

    If even Charles Oliveira canâ€™t beat Islam a second time, no way this clown would be able to beat Islam.
  
    As someone else said, heâ€™s scared of other welterweights like Shavkhat that heâ€™s trying to call out lightweights. How about stay in your own lane and eat whatâ€™s already on your plate.
