    Dude is probably a "fighter" as well and looks at Jon as his meal ticket, clout is currency.

    For real, Jon could probably kill any other human on the planet with his bare hands

    Love the part where Jon specifically tells the security to not hold anyone back. Jon was ready to kill.

    Bony was like "You're one lucky son of the bitch because I don't have my shotgun with me."
