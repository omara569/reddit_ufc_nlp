No wonder Usman has a 97% TD heâ€™s fighting wrestlers who couldnâ€™t even hold down out of prime ballooned up RDA ðŸ¤£

    Out of prime balooned up RDA is still a world class grappler. Khamzat couldn't keep burns down, or John phillips.  Khabib couldn't keep injured RDA down either so idk what your point is really

    Didnâ€™t he finish that guy and burns is 100x the defensive fighter off his back Colby is the best opponent heâ€™s ever beat and that guy is overrated as hell so what does that make Usman ðŸ¤£
