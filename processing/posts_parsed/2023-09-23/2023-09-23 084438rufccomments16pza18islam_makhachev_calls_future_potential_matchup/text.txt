Islam Makhachev calls future potential matchup with Colby Covington "Easy Money".

    Ok so check this out, Colby called Strickland a bum so that means Colby could easily beat Strickland. Islam says Colby is easy money, so that means Islam beats Colby and thus beats Strickland. And Islam already beat Volk. And Aljo, after losing to Sean, mentioned heâ€™s now not going to 145 to avoid what Volk would do to him.
  
    So Islam will be 5 division champ before this is all over. Science.

    See Colby, the numbers donâ€™t lie and they spell disaster for you at UFC 294

    at least someone called Islam out. For a long time nobody wanted to fight him, everyone was fucking afraid of him

    Colby is not even a threat to Islam on the ground like how Oliveira is and also let's play devil's advocate and say Colby manages to keep the fight standing(which I don't think he will) he would still get lit the fuck up by the same guy who gave p4p #1 Volk a run for his money in the striking department and schooled Oliveira in the standup
  
    Colby doesn't even have the KO power or timing for that lucky punch ðŸ¤£
  
    Atleast as a wrestler Islam faced a dangerous grappler in Oliveira and passed that test. Same can't be said about Colby who ducked Burns. Burns bjj will be a real problem for Colby but we don't know the outcome since Colby ducks everyone at WW. Atleast Islam erased the doubt by making Oliveira who was on a 11 fight winstreak look like dog shit.
  
    As an Islam fan I hope Colby becomes the champ and fights Islam. Easy 2 division champ

    Islam is pretty much better everywhere.  Colby might have a slight cardio advantage.

    Not when islam doesn't have to cut to 155. Dude kept a pretty good pace against Volk even with 12 hours less rehydration time, in his first 5 rounder. Also isn't as old as Colby
