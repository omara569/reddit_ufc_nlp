    "Volkanovski got the call yesterday.
  
    A reminder he had surgery on his hand just three months ago and is jumping in - at a higher weight class once again - on less than two weeks notice." - Ariel Helwani

    That just seems stupid. Why not have gamrot and then build up the rematch properly

    Makes sense. Israel is too big for Islam to take on. Volkanovski makes more sense.

    I’m really leaning volk this time, I thought he won the first time as it was very close. But I think volk is that type of guy, it’s another opportunity and I don’t see him letting it slip.
