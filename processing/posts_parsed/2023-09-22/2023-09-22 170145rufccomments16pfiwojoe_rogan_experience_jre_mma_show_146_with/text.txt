    I got a feeling we’re going to be disappointed in Francis’s boxing performance much like most of the other fighters who tried to go from mma to boxing

    Of course. If Francis doesn't catch his chin this will be a terrible fight.
  
    There's no shot anyone boxing for 8 months can hold a candle to someone who has been boxing since they exited the womb. The movement is so different.
  
    The only way Francis wins is if Fury seriously underestimates him and doesn't train.
