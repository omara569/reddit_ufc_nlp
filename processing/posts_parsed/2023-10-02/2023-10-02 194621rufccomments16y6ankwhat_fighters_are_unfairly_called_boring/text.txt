    Wonderboy. People often criticize him for lacking power, and often out-pointing his opponents to a decision. They remember him for the 2nd Woodley fight, till fight, and when he got wrestled back to back by burns and Belal.
  
    They forget his absolute domination of Macdonald, Ellenberger, Hendricks, Whittaker, Luque, Masvidal, Holland and Neal. Countless masterclasses, along with a whopping 3X FOTN and 5X POTN bonuses, good for 3rd all-time at welterweight.

    That Luque fight was something else. One of the greatest displays of Karate Iâ€™ve seen in a Mixed Martial Arts fight

    Sandhagan
  

    Who thinks Sandhagen is boring? Unless you mean his last fight.

A lot of people call GSP boring back in the day. Made me realize most people are very casual fans and don't actually like or appreciate MMA, they just wanna see someone get hurt.

    As I understand, GSP got a lot more cautious late in his career. Same with Izzy. They had bangers but then they won the belt and started being a lot more careful. Usman, on the other hand, started to get a lot more exciting before Leon knocked him out.

    Nobody says it anymore now that he is in ONE FC, but Mighty Mouse was called boring when he had 7-10 of his most current wins (at that time) as finishes

    Islam looks like he took a sip from Costa's secret juice.
