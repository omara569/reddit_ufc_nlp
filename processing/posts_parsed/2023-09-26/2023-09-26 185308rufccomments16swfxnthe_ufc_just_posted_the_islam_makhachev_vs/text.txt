Will undoubtably start back up debates in the comment sections but it’s nice to be able to watch this epic fight back. Two world champions going at it is always a good time.The UFC just posted the Islam Makhachev vs Alexander Volkanovski fight for free

    Highest level UFC fight there is. Pound for pound number 1 and 2 going at it, back and forth.

    I agree, while he didn’t win it was very close and he ended the fight smashing the p4p number 1 dagestani wrestler

    Rounds 2 and 3 were close. 1 and 4 Islam and 5 clearly Alexander

    islam really is a solid striker, he was getting the better on the feet against volk.

    Yeah, I think both Volk and Charles made the same mistake of underestimating Islam's striking and only seeing him as a wrestler.

    Don't think I've seen a fanbase cope with an L worse than Volk stans lol, posting a screenshot of Islam repeatedly looking exactly how he looks 95% of the time.  And I'm a Fedor/Aldo stan so ik how seeing your heroes epic streak end feels for what it's worth.

    I was rooting for volk but i thought islam won it pretty fairly. I can see an argument for volk though
