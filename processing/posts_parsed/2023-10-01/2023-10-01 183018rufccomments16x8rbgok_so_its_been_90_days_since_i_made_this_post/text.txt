Ok so it’s been 90 days since i made this post. After UFC 293, do you guys agree now?

    The crazy part is how you don’t use dark mode

    It’s not a bad take at all but personally I think Rob’s loss to Dricus was due to DDPs goofy style and raw physicality/power. I think Sean may appear unorthodox but in reality he sticks to the fundamentals, (1s and 2s, March forward, keep a responsible guard) which I think is exactly what Whittaker thrives against.

    Not a crazy hot take, Sean is hard to takedown and hard to hit.And I also question Whittaker's current state, I question if he is the same guy who did a mistake against Dricus or if he is slowly but surely slowing down.I'm confident that the best Whittaker beats the best Sean

    Im not worried about him slowing down but ive always been worried about his size and durability .
  
    Whittaker chin is just arguably the worst out of the top MWs and he isnt that big either so he doesnt really end the fight early , so he is constantly forced to go to a decision with people that have the capacity to KO him at any moment.

    I’d put my imaginary money on Bobby Knuckles

    I just can't imagine a scenario where Bobby turtles up and spends all night running backwards from Sean. This man went fuckin blow for blow with Yoel and lived to tell the tale. Sounds like a rough night for Sean

    I would still say Whitaker, he has many weapons. Adesanya only had one plan, when that didn't work he instantly lost.
  
    I can also see DDP beating Strickland.

    Honestly, Dricus is my betting favorite against the division.
