    Bro these two are legends. Volk 100% will go down as a top 5 GOAT. Islam may too if he keeps this up.

    I mean kudos to both guys but not sure how this doesn’t favor Islam more from the start:
  
    “You’ll pay me even more to stay in and it’s against an opponent who just had surgery and has no fight camp and has to cut weight on less than 2 weeks notice”
