She's like the only fighter outside of the UFC I actually pay attention to.People who watch ONE, so you think there's a possibility Stamp Fairtex joins the UFC one day?

No, She is such a star in One and Asia. I am from the US who lives in Southeast Asia now and people know her more than Jon Jones over here. Same with Angela Lee, Rodtang, etc. Even DJ is loved here more than the states it feels like.

Angela Lee


That retirement is heartbreaking

She wouldn't probably do it, even if offered . One lets fighters be multi sport combatants, UFC doesn't

Unfortunately the UFC would never offer her a better deal than ONE would. She is ONE’s biggest star, and she just won her first MMA championship. She’s not going anywhere

Is there a chance me and Stamp Fairtex get married and have many children together in a beautiful house and I am no longer stuck here in a dimly lit room where I scroll endlessly through Reddit and various porn sites to scrape what little dopamine my mind can salvage as they days and nights all blur into one?



No

Get in the line buddy

She a star, a bit green but can improve. Without 105 division in the UFC I prefer for her to say at One FC, she is a superstar in Asia and for Asian market so that's better for her to stay there.
