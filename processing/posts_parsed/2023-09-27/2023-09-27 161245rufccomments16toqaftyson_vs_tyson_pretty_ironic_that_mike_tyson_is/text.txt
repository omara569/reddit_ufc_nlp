Tyson vs. Tyson! Pretty ironic that Mike Tyson is training Francis Ngannou against Tyson Fury who was named after him

Just heard Francis on Rogan. Mike has barely been training Francis at all. This is so overblown.

Kinda. But Tyson Fury chose his own name. His real name is Luke Pritchard.

That's not his real name lmao. His dad's last name is Fury so how could he have Pritchard as his last name?

Having Fury as a surname is meant for a fighter then adding Tyson to that. The perfect name for a fighter lol
