I may have oversimplified some of the details but you guys get the gist.

Hmmm... Hold the press, might have gotten this wrong. Just started watching the "Hunter Campbell & Jeff Novitzky slam USADA: "What they have done to McGregor is disgusting." My opinions may have changed completely after viewing this. Idk it's an interesting situation, and feels like elements to it are unprecedented.

Also if anyone wants to debate by all means poke holes in my theory, I feel like I can already poke a few holes myself...

Now I don't really think UFC ever asked USADA to be "lenient" with McGregor's testing by any means now for one. But I'm not clear on what initially sparked this rift with UFC / USADA?

Could it have to do with the rumours of the highest level of fighters in Americans being tested at higher rates and more rigorously than say other fighters in the mountains of Dagestan and the likes? Basically the rumours allude to USADA potentially being paid off to be corrupt testers for specific fighters?

They should legalize it and force the fighters to wear shirts with the names of the substances taken. So everybody know what REALLY works ;)
