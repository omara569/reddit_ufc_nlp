Is Curtis Blaydes washed up?

Eternal gatekeeper. His standup didn’t get good enough until after he already got chinny from not having good enough standup early in his career.

Maybe in 2 or 3 years he'll be the final version of himself as a fighter but all the mistakes he did before will catch him and being chinny will be his main flue...

Don’t think he will ever be champion, but credit to him for stepping up and fighting Aspinall AND Pavlovich

Great fighter, not championship material though.

He and Volkov are the gatekeepers. They will probably never get the title but if you beat them you're for real.

Agreed. He has such a die hard fan base on Twitter but I don’t see him getting past any of the current top 5.

No he was never that good, good wrestler but he wasnt even a D1 wrestler, big and somewhat durable but his striking is shit and hes been getting rocked since mid 20s, he gonna have severe CTE by 34 the way his career has went. He can beat good HWs but not that great of a fighter if that makes any sense at all. Hes a worse wrestler than a Mark Coleman but alil more complete

That’s what we find out Nov 4 I guess.

Even if Almeida runs through him though, He, Volk, and Spivak are going to be completely insurmountable gate keepers to the top 5. Gonna be a bottle-necking problem 3 years from now, but it promises that the absolute monsters of Aspinal, Gane, Pav, and Almeida will be fighting one another almost exclusively, and that’s something pretty much everyone wants to see.

Not at all, he's simply better than every other heavyweight that's not in the top 5.

The elites in heavyweight are bona-fide killers, there's no shame in losing to Pavlovich

Nah, Pavlovich is just that good.
