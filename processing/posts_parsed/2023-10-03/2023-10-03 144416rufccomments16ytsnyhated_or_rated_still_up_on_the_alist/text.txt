    On the A-hole list for sure. The achievements that made him semi-quasi famous:
  


    Sucker punching a guy in a mall. He was losing to the guy  1 on 1.
  


    Throwing a tantrum after being tapped at a bjj tournament.
  


    Fighting a guy literally half his size in a sanctioned bout.

    Another over hyped one of those dudes but it's ight. We'll see if he does any better than the Magomeds/Ruskis not named Khabib.

    Was watching some of his kickboxing and MMA curious to see how he fairs. His kickboxing does not look nearly as high level as Izzy or Periera imo but he is very aggressive and exciting
