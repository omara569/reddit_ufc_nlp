    I will actually lose my mind if its Izzy. Usman seems more likely.
  
    The instant redemption Izzy could get from winning this fight though is an insane opportunity for him.

    Imagine itâ€™s McGregor thatâ€™d be hilarious, but in reality probably Usman/Izzy

    man DC is so good at his job, created so much hype for this card with this and got us excited again lol and the fight he's thinking of might not even happen and we will never know who UFC was talking to but it didn't end up working out ðŸ˜‚

    I actually kinda want this to happen at this point. Every Khamzat card will be a replacement fighter.

    He wanted to fight 2 guys same night, they should just let him crush couple of cans in one night at this point, at least it'll be exciting. All his scheduled fights end up falling apart lmao

    This makes it seem like it's has to be usman. Unless izzy grew a giant fucking pair of nuts over night or something.
  
    Maybe bobby knuckles? That fight was rumored before already. Bobby doesn't seem like he'd want that on short notice though.

    In the Dana interview he said he loves the city kickboxing guys like issy and Alex then talks about how game they are.....that makes me think it may well be issy!
