    Donâ€™t do that.
  
    Donâ€™t give me hope.

    Tony's unwell, he should not be fighting. The guy was talking about Moon floods, his wife waking up in the middle of the night to Ferguson standing over her accusing her of being a witch, and him thinking his son was the second coming of Jesus before Justin knocked the prime out of him. It should be criminal to sanction a person taking fucking Risperidone to treat schizophrenia to compete in combat sports and risk traumatic brain injury, which apparently happened back in 2011.
  
    The UFC's really gonna keep signing contracts with this guy until something tragic happens. It's shameless as hell. The warning signs were there for over a decade and shit has only gotten worse with Tony. If something tragic does happen, everyone's going to be writing about how they should have seen it coming, they thought it was all a character, they never thought it was really that bad, etc. etc. They'll open a fucking foundation in his name dedicated to the mental health of combat sports athletes to "make sure it never happens to anyone else" or some other PR bullshit to make themselves feel better after wheeling a psychotic man out like some court jester who writes goofy as fuck tweets so people will come and watch him get beaten repeatedly.

    This should be at the top. There needs to be a system in place to monitor fighters mental acuity that includes regular psychological evaluations. Too many instances of these guys getting to the ends of their careers and having some kind of emotional/mental breakdown. GSP ranting about being abducted and losing hours while conscious on JRE was heartbreaking; these guys throw away their bodies and their brains in pursuit of their goal, the UFC needs some kind of buffer for them.

    Dana was critical of Chuck stepping into the octagon a few years ago when Chuck and Tito had another fight but yet Dana is allowing this fight?

    Yes unfortunately itâ€™s not gonna happen though. He just looks physically weak in there. Bobby Green shouldnâ€™t be doing that to you

    People donâ€™t do it. Donâ€™t give yourself false hope: believe what your eyes have seen
  
    Paddy is alright at best, but heâ€™s in his prime and CURRENTLY magnitudes more athletic than Tony.
  
    This is a sacrifice fight. Tony in his prime would tear Pimblett up, no doubt, but we are far from those days.

    This. Did nobody watch that Green fight? Dude has the reaction time of a sloth.
  
    Seriously. To any doubters, go back and watch that fight. See how long it takes Tony to react to even the smallest feints. Dude's brain is cooked.

    tonyâ€™s the type of guy to break records for longest win streak AND longest losing streak in the lightweight division

    I met tony Ferguson. He's pretty chill and I do hope he gets it done come fight night. I'd love to see home KO Paddy. âœŠ ðŸ‘Š
