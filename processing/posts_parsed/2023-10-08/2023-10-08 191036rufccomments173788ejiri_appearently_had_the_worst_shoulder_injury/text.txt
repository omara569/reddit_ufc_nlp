    Jiri did his the month before Ortega did his. Ortega might get booked to fight January for all we know. They were both terrible injuries. I don’t get your point.

    Its insane how he can be ranked nº3 with one win in 5 years, including 2 massive beatdowns against Max and Volkanovski...

    Arnold Allen and Illia Topuria being ranked below him is a joke

    “But that guilhotina was so close!!!!” and he still lost the round. Volk beat the fuck out of him for all rounds

    the rankings suck and the match making to prop up new featherweights has not been great, we're lucky we have a contender for volk in topuria tbh

    Remove this bozo from the rankings or feed him to Ilia if he loses against Volkanovski.

    I completely forgot about ortega lol, hes just so forgettable he doesnt have any media presence and his personality is so bland, genuinely dont know how people can be a fan of this guy. I dont even dislike him hes just so bland and theres nothing to him
