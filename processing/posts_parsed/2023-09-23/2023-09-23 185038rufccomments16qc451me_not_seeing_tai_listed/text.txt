Me not seeing Tai listed ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²
My boy tai will never be champ and it hurts to say. Also Derrick Lewis should be on that list as well.

    Probably because Tai is to busy doing shoeys instead of actually training and conditioning for fights ðŸ’€

    Yeah bro he donâ€™t care and never does his management. After that beating he took from Gane 3 months later he agrees to fight Sergei Popovic thatâ€™s shows you donâ€™t have good people around you.

    Tai is a gatekeeper not a top contender.
  
    Not unless he wakes up and realizes that boxing isn't enough to get you to the top.
