    I remember a comment that said ‘Jon Jones is just a white cop trapped inside the body of a black man’

    Dave Chappele while being a very funny man was a larper bro acted like he was from the ghetto when he lived a comfy life. I respect Jon jones for atleast acknowledging he is a monster and was never a good person, sure he pretends to be at times but he has no one fooled
