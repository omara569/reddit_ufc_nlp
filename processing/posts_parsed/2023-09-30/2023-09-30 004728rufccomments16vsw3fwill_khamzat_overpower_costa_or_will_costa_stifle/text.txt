Will Khamzat Overpower Costa Or will Costa stifle the smothering chimaev?

Khamzat rolls here. It's going to be another dominant performance probably r1 GNP finish.

Something I think people don't get is even if Khamzat can't get takedowns for whatever reason it's still 50/50 on the feet. Marvin Vettori out struck Paulo Costa, Paulo is not amazing anywhere he's just physical and versatile enough to be a ranked guy. Khamzat has skills that are transferable to being a champion

If Costa wins, it will make Khanzat the most overhyped fighter in years.

Khamzat has legit wins in the UFC. He’s no longer a hype train. Is he a top 5 guy or nah is the real question here.

Imagine still thinking Khamzat Chimaev is a hype train, the dude is legit bro, we'll see what happen

Paulo couldn’t finish Luke in his last fight and got whooped by Marvin and Izzy. Khamzat wins this fight with ease.

It will be interesting to see how he deals with such a big powerful opponent but I just think his wrestling will be too much for Costa.

All I know is, I hope it goes longer than one round. I hope this one ends up being a war

If Khamzat stay focused and don't get into a stupid brawl like against Burns, he can win this fight to decision or find a finish.

I see a 50/50. Costa has been waiting for this fight for more than 1 year, he has been training for Chimaev since +8 months.

I think he has worked on specific themes in wrestling that Khamzat specializes in and he will be ready. Don't forget Paulo is a really good anti-grappler, one of the best at 185.

On the feet though, people are really sleeping on Chimaev's boxing, he is good technically, always moving forward, heavy-handed and I'll will not be surprised if Chimaev goes toe to toe in the striking with Costa.
