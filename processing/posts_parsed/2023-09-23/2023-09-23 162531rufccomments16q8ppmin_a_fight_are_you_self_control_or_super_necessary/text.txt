In a fight are you self control or super necessary

    Eeeeeeeeeehhhhh I still think the best mentality is for the fighter to fight until the ref stops the fight. You never know with some refs

    To a degree, but I've also seen egregious knockouts where the person is clearly unconscious to the opponent and they still do brutal follow up shots. It's their money on the line so I get it, but it's also the other guys health/future employment if the ref isn't there in time.

    It’s not binary. Even fighters who have hit people and not followed up because they knew the person was out have fights were they weren’t sure and followed up with GnP.

    “Super necessary” is great until the ref is Mario Yamasaki and the fighter is someone like Tony Ferguson

    Couldn’t tell you bro. Once I see red my fists take over and whatever happens, happens.

    Well my fighting experience is confined to video games but in games like soul calibur I do tend to continue to kick the opponent when they're down and the round is over so I guess I'm super necessary.

    Grabs from behind inflict maximum shame.
