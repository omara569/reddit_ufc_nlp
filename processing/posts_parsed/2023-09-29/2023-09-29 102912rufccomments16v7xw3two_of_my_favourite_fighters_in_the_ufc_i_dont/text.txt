    I have basically the same feelings towards Pereira vs Prochazka.

    Love both these guys. Islam has an underrated personality and is actually a great sportsman as seen here,

    If Charles wins I’m celebrating so hard, but if Islam wins respect to him and I’ll be looking forward to the Volk rematch or Gaethje fight

    I want to see Charles win, but I have respect for Islam. Charles and Volk my favorite fighters but I have zero shit to talk about Islam, only sad he’s takin out my dawgs
