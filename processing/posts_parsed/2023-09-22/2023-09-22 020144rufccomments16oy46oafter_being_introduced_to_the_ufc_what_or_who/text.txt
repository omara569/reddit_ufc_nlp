After being introduced to the ufc what or who made you think "I love this sport"? Here's my 4 because I couldn't pick only one.

    When Chuck Liddell kept hounding and whoopin Tito's ass. Tito tried so hard to avoid Chuck, and he was so scared when they fought it was crazy
  
    Also the Chuck and Randy saga

    Chuck and Tito was the first fight I ever watched and I’ve been hook line and sinker since. My dad had it on and I got to stay up and watch it with him after he got home from work. It was like a thing. Idk. Just a good memory.

    I started following the sport in 2007 and couldn’t afford many PPVs (I was a teenager) so I learned about the sport through Mike Goldberg on Spike TV presenting reruns, best ofs, etc.
  
    Randy Couture for coming back and winning the HW title from Tim Sylvia.
  
    Forrest Griffin for out-working Rampage for the title was my first holy shit moment.
  
    BJ Penn for licking blood off his gloves against Joe Daddy(?). Diego? I can’t remember who it was now.
  
    Anthony Pettis for the Showtime Kick against Benson Henderson.
  
    Probably some others I can’t remember right now, but these come to mind.

    Man spike tv was the shit for teenage guys haha. I used to watch the shit out of any of those UFC reloaded reruns
  
    Oh and I think BJ licked the blood off when he gave Joe Stevenson the beating of a lifetime.

    Forrest Griffin. Id been watching casually for years already, but his underdog status going into the Rua fight and then choking him out made me realize id love this sport forever

    That absolute bloodbath between Robbie & Rory has had me hooked ever since

    If I were to convince someone to be a fan, this is the fight I’d show them.
  
    If I wanted to give them recent fighters…I might show them Pantoja vs Moreno (3). Not for blood bath purposes, just well rounded mma.
