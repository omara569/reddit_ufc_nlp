Imagine a timeline where Tony finishes Paddy and then Conor. A man can dream.

    This is the plot to an 80s fighting movie. Tony is on top of the world, loses a bunch, loses a bit of himself, than comes back with a miracle win and after that beats the bad guy (think Bolo Yeung or Tong Po, only this time itâ€™s Conor). After that, the sequel to the movie is where Khabib comes out of retirement to challenge Tony. A man can have dreams right?

    Conor vs Tony (coming off a win vs Paddy) would be an amazing fight. Iâ€™m for it. Hell Paddy vs Conor too. Either way thatâ€™s a fire fight.

    Great send off for Tony financially, but he doesn't need anymore head trauma.
