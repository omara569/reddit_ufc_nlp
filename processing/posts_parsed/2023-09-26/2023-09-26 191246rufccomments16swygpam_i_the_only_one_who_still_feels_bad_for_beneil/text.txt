Am I the only one who still feels bad for Beneil? He lost his 8 fight win streak and title shot in a bad way and couldn’t show what he was capable of.

    Ferguson lost 12 fight win streak and was stripped of his title and was never capable of fighting Khabib.

    At least they tried to make that fight numerous times, they literally ignored Beneil for like 2 years and acted like he is not in a title contention at all

    Charles showed up that night and decided losing was not an option

    I feel bad for him. It’s kind of disrespectful how he’s just passed over when he tries to be active. When he had to pull out of the Islam fight because of a leg injury, the doctor told him it required surgery and he’d be out for a year. Instead he got a second opinion and was able to rehab the injury so he wasn’t out for long.

    I can’t feel bad for him because he doesn’t market himself and he just takes what’s given to him. Sucks, but you gotta play the game. Love his fights though

    Dariush didn’t exactly run thru the toughest guys on his win streak lol. The gamrot win was impressive but no one in the top 5. Chandler or gaethje  would have been 9-0 in that run to against that competition

    I was. One of those fights that i didn't want to see either fighter lose.
  
    Do we have any news about Beneil? I would like to see him against Poirier or Chandler. If he wins, maybe he will still be in the conversation for a title shot

    I think he is fighting Arman, not sure when

    Charles is my favorite fighter, so that victory was awesome to me. On the other hand, Dariush is a beast, but many people are calling him overated, when in fact he clearly isn't.
  
    He lost his chance for the belt by now, but if he beat 1 or 2 top 5 he gains a title shot again. Honestly, I favor him against every top 10 except Islam and Charles...
