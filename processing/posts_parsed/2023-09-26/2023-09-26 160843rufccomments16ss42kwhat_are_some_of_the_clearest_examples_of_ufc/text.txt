what are some of the clearest examples of UFC Champions ducking contenders?

    Michael Bisping fighting a 46-year old Dan Henderson instead of Romero shines the brightest in this regard.

    Germaine De Randamie outright refusing to fight Cyborg and getting stripped. Nicco Montano ducking Valentina and getting stripped.

    I share your frustration with this one. LW pissed me off so much during 2016/17 with Conor and Alvarez.
  
    Don’t get me wrong, the champ champ stuff was great. But it was bs matchmaking letting Conor win the LW belt with no defences and then hold on when he switched sport.
  
    Khabib should’ve got a shot after the Johnson fight and didn’t need to face Barboza. And Tony should’ve been promoted to undisputed champ.

    Conor Mcgregor literally ducked all the contenders while he was champ.

    This sub has the same amount of title defenses as Conor

    The clearest was when Iron Lady ducked Cyborg for the 145 titles and when Montana ducked Shevchenko or whatever her name was for the 125 title.
  
    Eddie wasn’t ducking Khabib because he was scared. It’s just that Conor was a much bigger name with a bigger payout, and stylistically, Eddie had the tools to beat him.

    Well that, AND more importantly Khabib had only fought  debuting Darrel horcher a few months earlier and was inactive for the 2 years before that.
  
    Would make no sense he get the titleshot then. Especially when it would have been UFC 205 the first time they were in NY and MSG ever.
  
    Also the UFC bought out Eddie's bellator contract that had a clause of $2.50 per PPV buy, that he could only take advantage of once champion.
  
    Saying eddie ducking is insane and ridiculous.
