Seems like every press conference Dana is talking about how they broke the venues total gate record. Is Dana talking about UFC events only or are they using different arenas, or is Dana bluffing similar to how powerslap got 300 million downloads….

Dana is a habitual liar.

Keep it up and one day they might be able to get close to Power Slap numbers

Ufc 300, with the right card, could be held in Raiders Stadium and do over $20 mil easily. UFC has a model they stick to and now are able to schedule events every Saturday and they all sell out. Boxing and UFC are not even comparable any more.

The right card:

OMalley/Vera main event

Four women's fights in a row

Bo Nickal versus a 16 year old for the only prelim fight

Early prelims will be Logan Paul's discarded WWE skits

What’s a 20 million dollar gate?
