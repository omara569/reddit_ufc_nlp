    I'm curious how figgy will do at 135. Hopefully he can take a shot, because Font can crack. His jab alone is going to cause serious problems.
  
    Font within 2 rounds. That's my prediction.

    Fonts reach is going to be a real problem for Fig

    Who will Cruz be fighting next then? I remember reading a long time ago that Cruz/Figgy was in the works. I wonder if Cruz turned the fight down or if it was never offered to him.
  
    The ranked fighters that aren’t booked & Cruz hasn’t fought yet are Sterling, Merab, Sandhagen, Yan, Yadong, Umar, and Simon. They will probably feed Cruz to Yadong or Umar at this point
