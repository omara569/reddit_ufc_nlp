Gimmick in full swing. Inviting himself on Sean O'Malleys Podcast because he thinks O'Malley needs Jesus. Oh, and a farm in Arkansas. (Not sure O'Malleys coattails are available)

    Yall need to realize that just because gimmicks exist doesn't mean everything is a gimmick. It's like yall expect every fighter to just actually be a normal human being which even if they weren't fighters taking that many people just statistically is going to yield some pretty weird results. Also, like go to Arkansas lol and tell me you still think that's a gimmick
