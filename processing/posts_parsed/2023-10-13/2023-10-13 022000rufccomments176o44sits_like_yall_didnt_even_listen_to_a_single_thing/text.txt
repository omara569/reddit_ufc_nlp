It’s like y’all didn’t even listen to a single thing Jeff and Hunter said about the situation. I’m glad they went the direction they’re going, USADA is no longer ahead of the game, just look at some of the physiques in the UFC.

They’re now going to test everyone for EPO which USADA doesn’t do and fund research in antidoping. They’re also going to fix the benchmarks USADA is currently using which are very flawed.

USADA didn’t say a fucking peep until the UFC told them they weren’t bringing them back, they sound like a salty ex.

People still got caught under usada. Where the fuck has all these usada fanboys come from? Now y’all are out of the woodworks, hilarious.

biggest thing USADA has found was TJ Dillashaw's EPO test and Jon Jones test for turinabol. Everything else has been shit that even the athletic commissions should have flagged, or it was a bunch of "tainted supplements" and people just smoking pot.

also it's hilarious that you bring up a picture of Conor when this issue started with him. he's clearly juiced up and has been dragging out this whole thing about submitting his paperwork because he obviously couldn't piss clean

We all watched grow into an ape.  He seemed to have gone pretty quick from never use his leg to full training.

I listened to the whole thing they seem 100% in the right. Had an answer for absolutely everything. It was a long press conference but very informative
