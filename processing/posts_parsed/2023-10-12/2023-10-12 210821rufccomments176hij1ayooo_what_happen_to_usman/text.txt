    Iâ€™ve always said 170 to 185 isnâ€™t that big a jump but apparently I was wrong, god damn Usman had to beef up for this one.

    According to my calculations itâ€™s not. Kamaru has been inactive since Leon and took this fight on short notice.

    Usman really is a fat middleweight, i reckon he could do a lot better at middleweight/light heavy

    This is true for most heavyweights. Heâ€™d probably do ok at light heavyweight

    Kamaru is still a harder fight for Khamzat than his 250lb brother lol
