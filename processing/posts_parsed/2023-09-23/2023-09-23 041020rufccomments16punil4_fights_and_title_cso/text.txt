    If this happens he would undoubtedly be the greatest athlete of all time

    Agreed. He would make it to the Mount Rushmore of sports. New power rankings would have to be:
  


    Tony Ferguson
  


    Michael Jordan
  


    Tom Brady
  


    Tiger Woods

    This might be a hot take but i still think Prime Tony aka 2015-17 would absolutely destroy everyone here except Islam. In his prime i still think he's top 5 best lightweights of all time. I think he would lose to Khabib, Oliveira, probably Dariush but he would actually beat Diaz, Justin, Green, Chandler.
