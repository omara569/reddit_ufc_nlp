I think he's 1 solid win away from a title shot. What u think?

    At this point he deserves the highly anticipated rematch with Islam.

    Maybe the fight will last three minutes this time instead of two and a half.

    Definitely I mean they are in the season of giving Islam rematches against people he dominated. Let’s do Bobby Green next then Dan Hooker after that.

    To be fair he dominated everyone he fought aside from Volk and the guy who knocked him out

    This year has been a year of pullouts. The way decisions are made, wouldn’t be surprised he slides in if Gamrot doesn’t make backup. Sometimes taking any fight and being always available is valuable in Dana’s eyes.

    Yea, and that's actually mad unfortunate for LW lol. Maybe 2-3 wins on a top ranked opponent cause 2-1-2 in his last 4 and his wins are Tony Ferguson and then Dawson which is a good win.
  
    But Dawson mind just have that chinny chin chin and could just be a case of him being over ranked and protected from the upper echelons of LW.
  
    Both of his losses were finishes.
