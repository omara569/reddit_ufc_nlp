    Youâ€™d have better luck betting on Barao to win

    you cant see it? Yusuff gets tired on the feet from having to defend against Barboza's jousting strikes, takes him down, gets complacent late in the fight and gets choked out? Barboza is a killer and lethal everywhere. This is Yusuff's first 5 round fight. It's unlikely anyone will get a stand up finish because there both pretty good at defending so Barboza has to get a finish somewhere else to win the fight?

    Barboza has on submission in his entire career, back in 2009. Yusuff has never been submitted.

    Still means it's plausible, its Yusuffs first 5 round fight and edson might know that he has to finish it to get the win, it's plausible that Yusuff will start shooting if he's up late in the fight and tired. He's not going to expect it.
