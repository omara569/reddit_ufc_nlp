I've just heard that Curtis Blaydes is out of his fight with Jailton Almeida and Derrick Lewis is going to step in

    What's Jailton going to do when Derrick Lewis just stands up and once again proves that BJJ doesn't exist?

    Yeah that being said if lewis can pull of the knock that could boost his ranking towards one more shot at the title

    I was so hyped for Blaydes vs Almeida, we have lost a great HW match-up. I hope we still see it one day. Derrick Lewis can do something hilarious in his opponent hometown tho Jailton has to be cautious.

    These odds bout to be to good to pass up on
  
    Almeida gon be at least a -500 favorite, it’s the year of the upset in MMA. I’m definitely gonna bet 5 on Lewis by KO.

    Hot balls + flying knees is the new dominant base.

    This was gonna be a great test for Almeida, what a shame. Choking out Derrick Lewis isn’t gonna prove all that much.

    Damn, really was excited to see how Almeida’s BJJ would’ve matched up against Blaydes’ collegiate wrestling, classic matchup between Brazilian and American grappling pedigrees
