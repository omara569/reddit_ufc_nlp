    LW will always be a deep roster with talent as most dudes are about that size. I remember people saying like imagine if MMA paid like what they do in football or more and we would see like an influx of crazy athletes, but I think it would effect the bigger weight classes really.

    I think Movsar Evloev. He just doesn't seem that great compared to other hyped fighters. Paddy is another obvious answer. I just think people considered legit threat, Evloev takes it for me.

    Illia topuria, hes a great fighter dont get me wrong but people are really giving him a chance against volk because he beat bryce mitchell and josh emmett? Come on now and he didnt even finish him ðŸ˜­

    I don't think his intention was ever to finish him, got a feeling they have planned this out similar to the Usyk situation. His team are really crafty and sneaky and i don't think they want to throw the cards at table and blow their load.

    I agree, but the thing is UFC needs to hype the next title contenders as the business needs that. Volk is something special that has been tested and proven dominant. Not much out there for challengers.

    Ian Garry in my opinion. Heâ€™s a great fighter but I think the majority of the top 10 can beat him.
