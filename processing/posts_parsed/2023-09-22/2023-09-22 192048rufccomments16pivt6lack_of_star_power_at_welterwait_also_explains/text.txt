    But Colby is a huge star isn't he ? How many PPV did UFC 272 (Covington vs Masvidal) sell ? UFC is so embarassed to leak the numbers.

    How did Khamzat get popular with his short time in ufc? It's sad to see Beneil getting a loss to Olivera. the guy made him look easy.

    Dominant, scary, exciting, has KO power, carries opponents around the octagon....basically unlike any fighter we've seen so far.
