    Such a shame USADA held Conor out from us. Wasting the last moments we have with Conor over this is so stupid. They should have tested him twice and let him fight right away.

    All Dana said was Conor was supposed to submit paperwork Monday, then he said some time next week.  Nothing has changed.  Nothing will change Conor ain't fighting again.
