Actually we lost the first deal to get an even better deal. So it's a win for fans. P4P #1 fight all over again if you exclude Jones

    Except, how prepared can Alex be with 11 days notice? In the first match he was rolling with the likes of Craig jones

    Craig who? And cardio is never an issue for Volk, he was definitely training as he was supposed to headline the January card
  
    Good edit on the Craig Jones. Not sure if that was typo before but I was about the drop the c word on you (casual)

    Volks is always training. Plus Islams camp was around Charles not Volk.
  
    They both have 10 days to prepare for each other

    This isn’t a better deal. Charles actually beat a top contender at 55 to earn a title shot. Volk already had his chance and lost convincingly.

    Did you not see the fifth round? And by “lost convincingly” you mean Islam was able to big spoon him for a while
