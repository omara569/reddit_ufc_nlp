    Everyone is acting like Tony isn't BJ Penn 2.0 lol Paddy will KO him stiff and it'll be another sad retirement

    I hope he sits there and eats 5000 calories of greasy dogshit while talking about what a legend Tony is at the press conference, and all these weird Tony cum guzzlers lose their shit. On the flipside, I also hope Tony rips his arm in half and starts talking about alien conspiracies and how he will never let the government take his children, and the fattest version of DC we have ever seen (its awesome watching him get bigger every show) has to uncomfortably pull the mic away from him. lololol. Such a win win. We don't get gifts like this very often.

    I do hope he actually improves significantly. Of course he can be annoying, but you can't deny when he wins its usually a spectacle
  
    He does have massive star potential, just from what we've seen not massive star ability
