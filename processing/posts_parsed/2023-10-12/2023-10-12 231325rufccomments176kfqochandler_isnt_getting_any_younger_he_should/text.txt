Chandler isn't getting any younger he should consider this fight. No guarantee Conor even fights again.

    If I’m Chandler, im not doing shit to jeopardize the McGregor fight, especially with how many guys are lining up to get that fight

    It would be a great fight for Dober, but what in the world would make Chandler take it? Dober is unranked, dangerous, and has little name value. Waste of air for Chandler to even acknowledge it.

    UFC literally just fired USADA for Mcgregor. Would be dumb for Chandler to consider Dober

    Obviously they don’t need to fight right now cause it’s not worth the risk of the Mcgregor fight, but down the line this would be dope

    When USADA leaves, you will literally see the first human with literal biceps on biceps, Michael chandler is going to look like Larry the lobster on steroids.

    The ufc literally kicked usada to the curb because of connor they're clearly willing to move mountains for his return him vs chandler is 100% gonna happen if not then wtf was the point of all that and him coming back.
