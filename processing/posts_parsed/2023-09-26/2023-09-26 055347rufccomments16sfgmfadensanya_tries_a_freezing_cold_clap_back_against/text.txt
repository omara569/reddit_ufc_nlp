    Why is one of the baddest men on the planet acting like a 12 year old? Imagine we lived in a time before social media and just knew him through his fights. We would've thought he's the coolest guy ever.

    Next time he should just fight better and not worry about the internet and drama.

    Izzy got more immature with age. While other champs become wiser and toned down, Izzy flipped the script and became more childish

    Maybe it was always his true personality? As he grew bigger he felt more comfortable to express himself. I don't think anyone turns into a weirdo like this shit unless they're on drugs or something. Easy to tell hes that one fucking weird kid from school

    When you have to attempt to differentiate between playing with a penis and masturbating a penis, you might be better off just not saying anything lol. Its not going to make things look better.

    Also trying to differentiate that it was “soft”. Serious lack of social awareness
