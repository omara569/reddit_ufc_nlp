Chito Vera striking defense and IQ is definitely underrated. He's not the most exciting but he's smart in there

Who would ever say Chito isn‚Äôt exciting?

The mentality of MMA fans is that you're only as good as your last fight.

Blame your ankle as much as you want but that ground and pound Chito put on him wasn‚Äôt defended. And that was all Sean‚Äôs fault

It's wild how he puts him to sleep with an elbow and then wakes him up with the next one üòÇ

Right but he got on top because Sean fell over.

How exciting Chito is depends entirely on his opponent's gameplan. He can be a very entertaining fighter like the Font fight. Or the most boring fighter like the Cory fight. O'Malley is likely the best BW striker but he will show some openings for Chito to counter. I feel like it'll be a fun fight.

Bro Chito is such an unreal chill as mf. His interview with Bradley Martin is so eye opening on how open minded he is and his diet and health. Hes really smart.
