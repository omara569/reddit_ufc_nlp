Volks activeness and consistency in the UFC is insane. And Still.

    I may be getting this stat wrong so feel free to correct me, but if Volk won I believe it would make him the first champion over 35 to defend a title below WW. Volk is up there with the goats no doubt, but i think Ilia’s time is coming

    We haven't seen enough of ilia yet. He beat a "sick" flat earther and a 38 year old Emmet.
  
    I'm happy he's fighting Volk and not going through Holloway first though because we really don't need Max turning back any more contenders

    Bro, he is the UFC 5 cover, the chance of he losing is 100%.

    This fight has me so nervous as a Volk fan, this is his biggest challenge at FW imo

    Topuria is hungry. It will be a close one I bet

    I know the community isn’t necessarily sleeping on this fight but I think it’s going to blow expectations out of the water.
  
    I think Ilia is going to cement to everyone why he’s the future of the division, but Volk is going to prove yet again why this is his era.

    If Volk beats Islam and Topuria in a 3 month span it’ll be unbelievably legendary

    This will be his hardest match up in the division. Will still win however

    If he wins this he's successfully made the entire division his bitch

    Yet you have Borz with a thumb up his ass and Colby not fighting either.
