Francis Ngannou had to ask for an advancement on his purse just so he could afford his fight camp.

    Why was he buying lambos if he couldn’t afford camp?

    I like Francis and the JRE podcast is a big platform to say some shit about the UFC. Granted fighter pay is shit for what the UFC make but he knows how to play the media game now. Fighters make like 50-60k a fight and still manage to take care of training camps ect ect. Francis will have been getting what? 500k per fight? I'm sure his coaches aren't demanding enough to see Francis broke.

    One of the funniest things Francis ever did was say he can’t afford to pay his coaches while he was wearing $30000 worth of clothing, and had a $20000 watch on.

    So Francis is terrible at managing his money. Am I supposed to feel bad for him?

    Sounds like he isn't very smart with his money or his managers are taking advantage of him

    I do think ufc pay is shit but at the same time francis is financially irresponsible, I think a large part of that is growing up uneducated in a third world country, but at the same time mate you can't complain about paying the bills while buying designer and luxury vehicles.
