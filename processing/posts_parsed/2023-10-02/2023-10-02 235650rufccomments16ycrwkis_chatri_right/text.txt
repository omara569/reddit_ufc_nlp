This is facts almost every fighter on ONEs roster was a champion at a high level before joining ONE a lot of them were Muay Thai world champions kick boxing world champions even Adcc and other bjj champions their MMA fighters and other fighters were either European champs or North American champs or Asian champs or world champs the only thing ONE is very very shit at is actually promoting their fighters to the audience they only even try for their biggest stars and even then they can’t really promote them that much

ONE is a solid organization, but the UFC is stacked full of the worlds best talent in every division outside of Men’s Flyweight

i watch both religously... Chadtri has a slightly different product bottled slightly different... but the skill level is so far in between. ONE has decent fighters, but theyre just missing that extra ... edge? UFC fighters have. UFC the athletes seem to want it more along with the glory of being a UFC fighter were ONE doesnt bring that noteriety and they attract the competitor rather than the athlete trying to be great... thats just my take maybe UFC seems better cause all the guys are juicier than ONE i dunno lol

The ufc probably has the most top guys, but they also have so many guy that are just shit.
