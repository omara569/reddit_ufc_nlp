Kamaru coming off two losses and then suddenly jumping up a weight class is not the smartest idea.        Now it's not to discredit his achievements but if anybody else was to suddenly take on this killer in a heavier weight, with history of having your chin cracked it seems like the odds are against you. Ufc needs to cement a new cash cow and nobody in middle weight wants to take the fight, so they're only option is to find a fighter in a lower weight class and just throw money at them.        This will probably be the fight they will justify Khamzat getting a title shot.Hot Take: If Kamaru takes the fight against Khamzat, then it's just another padded match for Khamzat and UFC knows it.

Fight an 8yo from Pennsylvania

Khamzat getting the special treatment because he is a special fighter. Kinda like Pereira.

I wouldn’t say it’s special treatment for Khamzat since Usman isn’t ranked at all at MW.

If anything it’s special treatment for Usman to get a money fight on a stacked card in a different division and that coming off of 2 losses. The only reason Usman is getting the fight is their history and him having been WW champ. This fight doesn’t even make sense tbh, but I’m here for it.

Khamzat doesn’t have a lot to gain from this. Even if he wins convincingly he’d still be a fight away from a title shot.

Flatlining Costa could’ve made him an immediate contender to Sean.

Disagree, Usman is a tougher opponent than Costa by a mile even if he’ll be lighter than Costa

I wish Izzy would’ve stepped in, but I think he wouldn’t want that smoke anyways, especially not 1 month after getting whooped by Sean

It’s something about Khamzat that just makes people have idiotic takes about him this makes no sense at all

hot take: Nebraksa Marty sleeps him

That would be insane and somehow one of the least insane things to happen lately

That’s stupid. What a stupid thing to say. Usman in the last 12 months fought Leon and won 6 of 10 rounds.

Huh? Usman is a tougher fight than Costa wdym? Did you not see Costa in his last few fights?
