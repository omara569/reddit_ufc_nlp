Anybody know about this chechnyan fighter? First name is hazmat?
Boris, is what they call him, Chimaev, which means wolf.        Khazmat is what they call him because, it's his first name.        Chechnya is where he's from because, that's where the hospital his mother had him was at        I COULD GO ON AND ON        Khazmat not-chimaev. First name is khazmat that's a story to me.

I liked Uncle Chael's old set, not sure about his new set up. And that's the real story here. I'm just bringing that to you because you didn't see it, but I did, and I'm sharing it with you so you can judge, on the merits, which is better. But I think we both know, don't we?

Nailed it. Just rambles for 10 minutes and I leave confused about everything.

Chael's ability to speak for 10 mins without making a point is impressive. He'd clean up if he entered politics lol. Most of his vids are like that but some of his early vids about the "Bad guy" helped me understand why fighters like him, Connor and even wannabes like Colby try to play the bad guy cuz bad guy v good guy fight sells every time and everyone wants to be a good guy so there's always demand for "bad guys" in the sport. He simplified it to supply/demand economics lol genius

Chael does not speak to make any kind of point or argument. He speaks to reach the next ad for his YouTube video.
