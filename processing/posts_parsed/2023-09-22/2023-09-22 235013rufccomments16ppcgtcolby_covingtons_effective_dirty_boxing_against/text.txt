    That's not dirty boxing.

    So funny how people try and use terms to sound more knowledgable.

    I don't remember Leon ever fighting Usman like that.

    How is this dirty boxing??? Dirty boxing is like, clinch work and using your arms and pushing and shit like that, not just sloppy looking punches.

    I thought they were clean seeing how they kept Usman from certain positions but far from dirty boxing. If OP wants to see actual dirty boxing then go watch Roberto Duran highlights

    Colby ducks his head down a lot when he throws punches wouldnâ€™t be surprised if Leon caught him with a nasty knee

    Imagine if this guy had just average power behind his punches

    I thought the whole point  of pressure was to overwhelm your opponent with volume while not tiring yourself out. Going for too much power would be counter intuitive, no?

    this is why Usman thought he could stand with Leon and got smoked out
