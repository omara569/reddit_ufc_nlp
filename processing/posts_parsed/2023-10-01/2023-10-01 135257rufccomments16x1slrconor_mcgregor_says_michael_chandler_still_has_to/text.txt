    “Yeah Mike, you just sit there without your main source of income, stalling your career while I dick around with my millions until I feel like fighting.”
  
    Amazing that this massive bellend gets to hold up other fighters and the UFC as a whole time and time again. I doubt Chandler wants to sit around not making money and not fighting, he’s wasting his time.

    To be fair, if they do end up fighting, then Chandler makes more money in this one fight than he would have if he fought 3 times already.

    This guys been out of the game far too long, dosen’t have the fire or hunger for a suitable comeback, I don’t get why Dana keeps pushing the narrative, can’t believe that he believes that any UFC fans believe him. The delusion is strong with this one.

    The reason Dana will always let Conor fight.

    I dunno how controversial of an opinion this is but I think McGregor's never fighting in the UFC again.

    It’s literally a very common opinion unfortunately, wouldn’t say it’s controversial at all
