‚ÄùThe relationship between USADA and UFC became untenable given the statements made by UFC leaders and others questioning USADA‚Äôs principled stance that McGregor not be allowed to fight without being in the testing pool for at least six months. One UFC commentator echoed this, recently declaring that USADA should not oversee the UFC program since we held firm to the six-month rule involving McGregor, and since we do not allow fighters without an approved medical basis to use performance-enhancing drugs like experimental, unapproved peptides or testosterone for healing or injuries simply to get back in the Octagon.‚Äù

All because McGregor couldn‚Äôt stay natty

He would certainly know a "dirty scumbag move" when he sees one.

USADA announced that it was because of McGregor

They wouldn‚Äôt give Conor a pass and let him fight without re-entering the pool.

They announced the departure yesterday, which as a 50/50 part of the relationship, they‚Äôre entitled to do.

Dana is just crying like a bitch as usual because he didn‚Äôt get his own way.
