    splashed some money in volk when it first opened (was +215). too good to pass on. honestly so many unknowns about kamaru vs khamzat, personally will probably stay clear. maybe splash on usman by KO/decision, and khamzat by submission/KO.

    I disagree. Islam fought Volk in Australia, with less hydration time, without the help of Khabib and faced 8 week training camp volk and STILL won.

    You gotta do a 5-leg parlay with Khamzat and all of the Russians on the main card

    Okay on the real, as a massive Khamzat fan who can't wait to see him win, -290???!?!?!? The fuck are these disrespectful ass odds lol Usman should be favored... Even like +100 Usman I could see, but +235??? Are the sports books assuming his knees blew out right before accepting this fight?
