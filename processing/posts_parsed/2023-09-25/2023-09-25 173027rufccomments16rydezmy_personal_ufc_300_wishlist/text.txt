    No chance Merab will headline UFC 300. It will be a way bigger fight than that.

    I know that is very unlikely. Although, one can hope. If anything it probably wil be Chito, but Merab deserves the title shot.

    Ain't no way Merab's boring ass would headline any PPV let alone UFC 300. He should headline Fight Night 300

    I feel most likely they gonna end up with conor vs nate3 / chandler as main and Volk vs Islam co main

    I think this is the most accurate guess Iâ€™ve seen yet. Who else do you reckon could be on the card out of curiosity?
