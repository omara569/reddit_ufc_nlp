Zhang vs Yan is confirmed to be on 297, Merab vs Cejudo as a title eliminator to see who will fight for the bantamweight belt next, Mike Malott because it's a Canadian card against a random unranked fighter.)My version of a 297 card (explanations for a few of the fights in post)

Good and realistic card. I always yawn when people create cards with 3 men’s title fights, it’s pretty unrealistic

Sean shouldn’t fight Chito. Give him Merab
