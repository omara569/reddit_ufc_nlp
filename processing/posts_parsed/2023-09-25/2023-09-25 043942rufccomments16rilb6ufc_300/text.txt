UFC 300
Since everyone is posting their dream card, here’s my go at it. Considering the timeline of all fighters. These seem feasible and the fight outcomes are meaningful.        It would be nice if Sergei and Tom could also fight on the upcoming Jone’s card. That would make the HW fight even bigger.        What would you change?
