How would Usman do if he were in the ufc? Could he become champion?

    Heâ€™s only 25 and Islam is still champ so not yet. But by the time Islam moves up, he will be for sure.

    Give him a couple of years.
  
    He has the potential to become even more dangerous than Islam.

    If Islam moved up, then I don't see who could stop him.

    He's definitely the next gen dagestani  fighter. We seem that in Islam too but more in Usman cause he is just 25. So maybe in 3 yrs I could see him steamroll everyone in the UFC.

    The 155 division is stacked as fuck but a lot of the guys at the top are aging. It's only a matter of time before Dustin and Justin start being taken out by younger, faster people.

    18-0â€¦of course he can be champion. If bellator does close down, i hope islam moves to welterweight and usman goes into the ufc lightweight division. Also crazy he is only 25 and dominates every fighterâ€¦

    Of course he could. Many fighters could. Anyone envision Strickland becoming a champ?
