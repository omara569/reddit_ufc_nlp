So first of all , he isn’t that old, ( only 39) and there’s been plenty of amazing fighters that are older than him. Second of all, his losing streak can be explained other than just being declining, he had winning chances against Gaetjie and was able to take Beneil and Charles to decision, which is really impressive, he was also winning against Michael and  he only lost to Bobby because of a bad eye poke. Finally he’s El Cucuy…… it’s always Tony time right? Right? Please agree with me, i can’t handle another loss.Okay hear my completely biased take on why it’s still Tony time.

Tony should retire and shift his focus to teaching. Not MMA I’m talking about quantum physics at Stanford.

He has one job left to do… and then he can rest… Paddy must be put down.

Funniest part is if Tony beats Paddy, fights again and keeps losing, it just makes Paddy look even worse

I think his point is that people like Stephen Thompson exist. But not everybody can halt aging at 29 like him

Being in your late 30s is a rough age historically for lighter weight classes. Your speed is starting to slow down and durability may not be up to par. I'll always root for Tony, but this might be his last time in the octagon.

On another note, Paddy likes to stick his chin out a lot, so hopefully Tony can capitalize on that.
