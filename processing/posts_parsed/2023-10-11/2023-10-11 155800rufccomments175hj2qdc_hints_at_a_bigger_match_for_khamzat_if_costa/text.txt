DC hints at a bigger match for khamzat if costa falls through (towards the end of video about 9:30)
Man he's got me psyched and thinking Bo might be in the wings. For me, that's the hypest fight. If not Bo who might DC  be describing as an even bigger match than Costa?

    If It's Usman, why would they make It If Khamzat wants to fight for the title at MW and Usman Is a WW moving up In a division he's not even ranked at. That doesn't make sense to me, but hopefully It'll end up being a banger.
  
    I'd prefer It to be Cannonier, but we'll have to wait and see.

    I agree, doesnâ€™t make much sense other than it will attract a lot of attention given the fact that itâ€™s Usman. The fight would be an absolute banger but I would much rather see Chimaev fight a ranked MW fighter.

    This aligns with Gildert post footage of Kamaru sparring and the ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ emojis. Would be a banger! Would it be at middleweight though?

    If that's the fight, I don't see why it wouldn't be, but yes. It would be huge without a doubt.  I would be tripping lol

    ofc, khamzat is not cutting to 170 after bulking this whole time, I think his move to 185 is permanent. He's much bigger now, look at his early UFC fights vs now or even pre UFC fights.
