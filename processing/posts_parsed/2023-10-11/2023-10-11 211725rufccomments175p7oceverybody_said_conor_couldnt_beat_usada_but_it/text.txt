What do we think is more likely:

A bunch of people get popped for PEDs for the first time in early 2024, or we start to see more super soldiers in the ring?

Get popped by who? A private detective hired by the Diaz brothers?

I think we should take bets now on who's coming out of retirement.

Conor has had 2 wins since 2016. Cowboy Cerrone and USADA, both by TKO.
