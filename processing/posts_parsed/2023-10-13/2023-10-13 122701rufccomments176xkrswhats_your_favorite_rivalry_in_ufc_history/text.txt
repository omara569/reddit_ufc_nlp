Every now and then I find myself going down the Jones vs Dc rivalry rabbit hole… I love it. Hands down my favorite rivalry and imo the greatest.        Also, does anyone know where I can watch this full interview? I see there is a 2 min clip on YouTube but I want to watch the whole thing. I’ve never seen the full interview, just clips.What’s your favorite rivalry in UFC history?

    Alex and Izzy was one of the more memorable ones that played out pretty fast, but for me personally, and having at least two fights might be Conor vs Nate.

    Jones vs DC, no doubt. I just watched their interviews again past week, top tier entertainment.

    Jones vs DC, Izzy vs Alex, Chuck vs Tito, Conor vs Nate, and Usman vs Covington were all pretty good rivalries.
  
    Jones vs DC will always be the best

    No one but Jon could make dc look as bad as he did that night.
