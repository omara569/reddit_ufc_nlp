    I bet Jamie feels a lot better about this loss now that Volk is on his way to being one of the GOATs

    Kind of off topic, but I love when fighters have restraint on follow up punches. I know youâ€™re supposed to go until the ref stops you, but having that restraint means youâ€™re in complete control of the fight and know exactly whatâ€™s going on. I just find it impressive to have that clear of a mind in the midst of an adrenaline- fueled fight.

    That's why some of Ngannou kos look a bit awful to me for example.
  
    He clearly didn't need to murder Overeem with that follow up punch, but still decided to do it.
