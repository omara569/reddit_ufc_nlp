Islam will win. Islam is a Khabib 2.0 It's almost impossible for Oliveira to win. Are you really going to root for him? Me asf:

    I don't think Islam is going to win because he's Khabib 2.0. He's going to win because Volkanovski showed him his vulnerabilities and whats possible. He just has more momentum at this point than Charles does.

    The only vulnerabilty Islam showed was his conditioning was a tad bit less than volkanovski, maybe due to jet lag or something, this time around i dont think such an issue will crop up but im excited to see how it will go down. My take,  if charles need to win this he has to be the better striker

    The Volk fight also showed his vulnerabilities which Charles can work with. I’m not sure if Islam will win easily, i see it more as a coinflip and i really like Charles too so maybe some bias.

    Remember when a year ago people were bleaching their hair before the fight? Yeah that was funny.

    Do we have any early lines on this fight from Vegas?
  
    Edit: Islam -340 and Charles +265
  
    Personally I think these are both off by about 200. Islam going to walk through him.

    I'm interested to see if Charles utilises headkicks like he did against Benny. That could really make or break the fight.

    Head kicks on the scariest takedown artist

    He did use headkicks against Islam, just weren’t a big part of his game and they were easy to read, even against Benny the head kick was heavily telegraphed. Watch both the Islam and Benny fights, he kinda leans back and swings his leg in a distinct manner

    I don't think anyone will find you crazy for "rooting" for Charles lol. It's more about Charles fans actually thinking he's going to win.
