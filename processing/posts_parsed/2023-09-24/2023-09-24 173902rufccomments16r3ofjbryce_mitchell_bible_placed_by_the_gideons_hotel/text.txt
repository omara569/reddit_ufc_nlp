    hotel bible placed by an evangelical organization
  
    he could be playing a bit, but he's trying really really really fucking hard for this bit to come off as real.

    He's not too off base. If you act like an idiot and get a good following of fellow idiots, Dana only sees money, not idiots. Bryce gets more fights.

    It’s not a bit. He is actually just mentally handicapped.

    I think it's real. Before the now over the top things he's doing with religion, he prayed with Barboza after the fight, said he was donating half his pay check 45kish to a childrens hospital. And he's from Arkansas. They also tend to get more riled up when someone tells them or they know the other person is non religious.

    I believe he's genuinely like that but he just heavily exaggerates those aspects of his personality to promote himself

    The group that places them have literally said they consider people taking those bibles home with them a success.
  
    They’re an evangelical group, giving people bibles is their whole schtick

    It’s definitely a bit of both. It’s obvious that antics like this brings views and views bring more fights. So yea it’s definitely a gimmick, but it may be coming from somewhere sincere(ish)
