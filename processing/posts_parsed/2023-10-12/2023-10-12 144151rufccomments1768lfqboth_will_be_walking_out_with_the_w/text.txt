    I want Volk to win, but the odds are stacked against him. His biggest chance to win was in the first fight. He had hometown advantage, full camp and Islam didn‚Äôt have enough time to fully rehydrate. He also underestimated Volk‚Äôs wrestling defense. This time, Islam won‚Äôt underestimate him. It will be in Abu Dhabi so he will have more time to rehydrate. Full camp vs 11 days notice. I think Islam is gonna win this more dominantly than the first fight. But I do hope I‚Äôm wrong. I‚Äôm rooting for Volk.

    I‚Äôm not so sure. Volk said himself he thought the extra power didn‚Äôt help him, he felt he was slower. Plus, volk catches on pretty quickly and has an amazing coach, he started realizing after the rounds progressed how to figure him out, hence how he knocked down Islam round 5. I think he actually gets it done, he knows that years down the line nobody will remember why volk lost and it‚Äôs just another win on Islam‚Äôs resume if volk loses. He‚Äôs not dumb, his legacy is on the line. Back to back losses to the same guy will tarnish his greatness. He realizes it‚Äôs not power to beat these dagestani guys, but speed, pressure, and good TDD. He looked better after every Holloway rematch, he will get it done this time.

    I doubt it. I will cheer for both, but it will most likely not happen...
  
    I would bet on Volk if it wasn't a 10 days notice fight (also it's Abu Dhabi), and I wouldn't bet on Usman anyway.

    I respect Usman, he is probably an all time great and I think he is gonna beat Khzamzat. With that said, I do not like him, I do not root for him and I'm hoping he is getting finished.
