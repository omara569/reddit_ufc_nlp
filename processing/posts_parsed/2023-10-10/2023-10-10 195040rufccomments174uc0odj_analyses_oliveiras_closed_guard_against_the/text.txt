DJ addresses Charles using overhooks against Islam to nullify his attack instead of trying to escape.        Charles’ biggest issue in the grappling was that he had no answer to being stuck on the fence. He was purely defensive in that position. Will that change in the rematch?DJ analyses Oliveira’s closed guard against the fence

    It's 40 seconds left to the end of the round, no reason to expose himself trying to stand up. The objective there is to survive and avoid damage

    Ending the round not getting smothered or GnP is the better look for the judges

    I think he was still dazed from the side ippon osoto gari, from 2:33 minute onwards of the round he was literally just trying his best to survive the round, blood was pooling into his eyes and islam hit him pretty hard with ground and pound. I think he was just trying his best to nullify islams punches/elbows, if he did posture up and try and get out it wouldn't have made much difference tbh, he would just find another entry

    Charles problem is he isnt methodical. Hes opportunistic. Khabib and islam know what they will do if you do xyz. They do x to get you to do y so they can get to z and know the heirarchy of every position and next step.
  
    Charles will never beat islam just winging it like he does.

    charles lack of positional grappling is just so detrimental to his game when he's fighting islam.

    Easy to analyze but just like cejudo, you can’t always act on that in the fight
