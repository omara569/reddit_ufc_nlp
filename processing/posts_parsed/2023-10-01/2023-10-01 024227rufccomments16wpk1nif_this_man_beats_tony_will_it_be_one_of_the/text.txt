If this man beats Tony will it be one of the worst victories we have been forced to watch? We all know prime Tony butchers Paddy.

    Chael already picked Tony, so things aren‚Äôt looking good. We gotta tell Drake to lay off this one

    Like eat 50+ punches to the head and not even notice it to eventually win a TKO?

    Not if. When.
  
    It does not matter if prime Tony beats him. He cannot beat him now. After watching his fight with Green, I've seen all I need to. And I know past fights aren't indicative of future performance, but his reaction time was just sooooo slow. He bit every single feint. Dude's brain is cooked. Needs to retire.
  
    Paddy isn't a great fighter, but he's significantly younger and more athletic than Tony is at the moment. Kid is gonna explode on the geezer and it's going to be fucking tragic.
  
    Like killing a unicorn. Wit like a bomb

    Paddy is going to destroy Tony.
  
    I agree that Prime Tony beats Prime Paddy, but Tony is so far from prime that it isn't funny.

    I'm hoping Tony wins. I might be crazy but I believe he does it

    I think we‚Äôre all crazy thinking the same thing. Tony will do so well in the first & then it‚Äôll go downhill from there tbh

    I can respect political and moral differences but the way he acted after the controversial decision against Jared Gordon was douchey.
  
    I‚Äôm gonna hate the fuk out of this guy if he beats Tony, especially cause I think Tony is better on paper even with the losing streak.  This matchup really strikes a nerve with me ‚òπÔ∏è
