    You’re right. Having beat number 10 ranked Jailin Turner & then number 6 ranked Fiziev (a win is a win) back to back, he should have asked for an unranked fighter next 🤦🏻‍♂️
  
    He’ll be ranked at least number 6 on Tuesday
  
    5, Chandler is waiting for the Conor fight. 4, Dariush, he’s already fought and it’s too soon for a rematch. 3, Poirier has said he only wants to fight the big money fights (whatever that means). 2 Gaethje is waiting on a title fight. So that leaves Oliveira should he lose next month. Perfectly reasonable call out.

    Poirier and Gamrot are also training partners. They’re not gonna fight.

    So who should Oliveira fight next if he loses to Islam again next month? Gamrot seems like a fine fight.

    All this gamrot hate seems very unwarranted i challenge anyone to tell me why its deserved. Mentioning his fight record has literally nothing to do with the hate because he doesn't control the judges scores or his opponents injuries. Gamrot ain't done a thing wrong

    Loses to Dariush, Decision over Turner, CLOSE decision over Arman, gets a lucky break (literally) over Fiziev and gets on the mic shouting how he beat the number 6 guy and Oliveria is next all the while having a style like Belal Muhammad

    This is mma u casual. Anyone can win any fight just look at the adesanya fight where he fought like the monstars stole his skill.

    Hopefully this guy gets smashed soon after his lucky decisions against Tsarukyan and Turner & fizievs injury
