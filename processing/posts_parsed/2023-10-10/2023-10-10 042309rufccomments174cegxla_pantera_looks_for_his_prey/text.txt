    It was disappointing to see him just quit mentally vs Volk. Dude didn't even try that hard and was willing to accept the loss. Should learn the dog mentality from his fellow Mexican Alexa Grasso.

    Pantera is a femenine word in spanish. Kobe Bryant's "black mamba" (la mamba negra)  would be femenine too, no disrespect here.
  
    Tbf i dont know if there's a rule in spanish for what animals have femenine or masculine pronoums.
