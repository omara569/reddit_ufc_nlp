Name a fighter didn't expect to like but now highly rate
Name a fight (any fighter) that you didn't rate but has significantly grown on you.

Johnny Walker, dude was a walking meme after the Corey Anderson but he’s quietly put in the work and stay true to himself. Now he finds himself in a title eliminator with a very good chance at winning, I always thought Ankalaev is very beatable and Walker just has those freakish finishes that he can pull off any moment of the fight. Imagine Johnny fighting the winner of Jiri/Alex! That’s a crazy thought but totally possible

O’Malley. Didn’t think he was a championship level fighter but he’s elite

Yeah, he really silenced some critics! And he's exciting for the future.

Definitely didn't expect to see Leon in this light after '3-piece and a soda.'

Benoit St Denis.

Looked like a walking punching bag with limited skills in his debut on short notice up a weight class. Turns out he’s the 155 terminator and will be impossible for me to pick against going forward.

I must admit he has grown on me a bit and he has a solid training effort.

Who’s the guy bottom right?  For the life of me I can’t remember his name.
