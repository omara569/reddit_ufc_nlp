Should Islam pull out and re-schedule the fight, holy shit this is another lose-lose scenario

    It should be Gamrot, it would not be fair to Volk.

    Lolololol biggest lose lose situation.
  
    If he beats Volk, Volk has even more excuses than before. Beating a FW who stepped up on short notice to fight Islam in his “home town”. No P4P ranking improvement.
  
    If he loses to Volk, it’s over for Islam. Legacy stained. Momentum destroyed. He loses years of progress and Ariel Helwani will literally cream himself non-stop for a full year.

    Ffs, unluckiest champion on the roster right now.
  
    The first fight was bad enough, where Islam could win nothing and lose everything, this is the same amplified by 10

    If Islam wins, the Volk saga will probably be over and done with, then he can defend a couple times before moving up.

    If he finishes Volk or even just wins a non controversial decision he will get #1 P4P. That being said id rather see Gamrot cuz Volk has a FW opponent that was just recently announced and there are plenty of lightweight contenders. No one is talking about Gaethje who just beat 2 ranked guys earlier in the year and hasnt fought Islam yet.

    Islam is being set up by the UFC, there's no other possible explanation

    no never because 1 - he is muslim and fighting in the middle east, 2 - he gets paid, 3 - he is not a pussy and probably welcomes the challenge.

    My dude if he welcomes "the challenge", let's say he dominates
  
    Vokanovski now has 100 excuses under his belt about how he would have won with more preparation
  
    The fans OBVIOUSLY won't take this well, Islam's legacy is gonna be discredited, this won't make him more popular with fans
  
    Every single punch Volkanoski even lands is gonna be a win to the fans, any minute on the clock Islam doesn't finish Volk it'll reflect bad on him
  
    Now let's say he loses
  
    This is massive because it will literally derail and possibly end his career forever.
  
    They ARE setting Islam up, ffs, the correct move would be to pull out, he's not gonna get any credit for winning, no actually, not even that, he's gonna get hate for it, and if he loses it'd be terrible for his career
  
    Either pull out or ask for a guaranteed follow up double champ shot is the correct move.

    Win win for Islam.
  
    He’s going to have to fight Volk again eventually. Now he’s got him on home soil with Volk stepping up out of camp on 11 days notice.
  
    Perfect for Islam.
