Do you feel he was really hurt or just had enough of Malkoun?

    Was watching live, he definitely wanted out of there. That being said, that was an awful shot to throw by Malkoun, you gotta be better than that.

    Probably both. You can get really hurt or even worse from getting hit like that. Plus he was doing it all fight. Well deserved DQ.

    that is probably the most dangerous strike a fighter can take in MMA. Dude dropped a forearm onto the base of his brain. Of course he was really hurt.

    I feel that if you’re Malkoun you 100% just can’t throw that shot there

    He knew he couldn’t win may as well get out with a NC or a DQ. He won a fight by being a punching bag.

    Clearly wasn’t hurt. He was getting his ass kicked and knew it would be a DQ not a NC

    Took the easy way out.   Stupid as fuck that this wasn't a NC

    Definitely both.  But why can’t we get rid of DQs  ? Idk maybe call it a NC and then dock the fighter who committed the fouls pay  ?  Treat it like a missed weight thing.  Idk giving a dude a win who was getting his ass beat is never a good idea.  Look at the aftermath of aljo v yan.  That changed the course of a couple careers.
