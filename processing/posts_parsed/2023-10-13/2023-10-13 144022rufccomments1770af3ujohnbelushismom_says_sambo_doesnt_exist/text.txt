    the important part of sambo is that it puts emphasis on the transition between striking and grappling which is something BJJ guys consistently struggle with

    Khabib once explained that sambo uses hip and leg to hold and manage the opponent down, so the hands are free to punch and strangle

    Going by this logic, MMA doesn't exist. If he gets a head kick KO, that's a that's a kickboxing technique. If he gets an elbow KO, that's a Muay Thai technique. If he wins with punches, that's boxing.

    He listed everything but conveniently left out striking, which is an important part of sambo
  
    The experience that these guys(Islam, Khabib etc) have transitioning between grappling and striking is one of the reasons they are so successful in mma
  
    If you punch a bjj black belt during grappling he will become a blue belt. If you punch a sambo practitioner he is still a sambo practitioner
