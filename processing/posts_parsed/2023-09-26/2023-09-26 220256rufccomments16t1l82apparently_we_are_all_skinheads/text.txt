    beer drinkers and skinhead white guys love boxing. i will never understand why guys like this are convinced that boxing is seen as some kind of royal art (like it's fencing or some shit)
  

    that being said, mma is for beerdrinkers i'm ngl

    100% for beer drinkers it's the equivalent of Roman gladiators fighting, just weird that he thinks boxing is like you said royal art

    Nothing wrong with skinhead beer drinking white guys. Strange statement to make from Bob Arum.

    I like both, I mean fuck what you expect bob to say? Be humble and all that, he donâ€™t roll like that anyways, it was a dumb comment but i get it, at that time UFC was beating Boxing on PPVs regularly.
  
    I just need Bob to outlive Don King

    The idea of boxing people trying to be elitist to another combat sport. Like why? Itâ€™s still pugilism still bloody still risks the future of each athlete that does it and still has promoters that rob the athletes blind.
  
    But yeah mma fans are def Neanderthals lol
