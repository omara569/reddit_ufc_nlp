    He is fighting someone, who was preparing for a 145 Fight and took the Islam fight on 1 week notice with no camp at all. Volk will be way lighter than Islam. Sure, its 1 week notice for Islam aswell and it's still Volk but Islam is heavier and had camp. So No surprises, that He doesnt get that much credit If he won, but in 10 years people wont Care about that. They will Just know Islam and Volk fought.
