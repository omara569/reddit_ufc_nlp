    GSP, Hughes, Usman, Tyron. Definitely an argument to put Usman at 2 though, wouldnâ€™t be upset either way

    I like it because Matt also had a 5 defense reign but also won the title again over GSP. But who knows Usman may have a few fights left in him who knows if he can turn it around, but I doubt it
