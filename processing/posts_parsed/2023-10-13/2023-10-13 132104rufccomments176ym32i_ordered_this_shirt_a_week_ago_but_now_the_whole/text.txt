    Card subject to change, but I would keep it if I was you.
  
    I can imagine a poor bloke got a shirt for that Diaz vs Khamzat card ironically. And was in this same position.

    Wear this shirt to a UFC event in a year. Everyone will love it. I wonder how many people are running around with a Ferguson vs Nurmagomedov shirt.

    If it's any consolation, you'd have looked like a wanker wearing a shirt with the new card on it too.
