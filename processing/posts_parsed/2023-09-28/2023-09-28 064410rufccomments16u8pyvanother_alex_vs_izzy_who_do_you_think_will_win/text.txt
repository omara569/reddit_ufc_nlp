Not even Alex can fix this dumbass. This cannot be on Alexâ€™s record

I've literally never seen Danis fight, much less box. Logan looks like a much bigger dude, and even though we give the Paul Brothers shit, they've beat every old MMA fighter put in front of them.

Statistically, I give it to Paul.

Paul is on the juice , he's juiced up to the gills man.

Danis has shadow boxing vids, he looks like hot garbage.

*jake has beat every old mma fighter in front of him. Logan doesn't even have a single win.
