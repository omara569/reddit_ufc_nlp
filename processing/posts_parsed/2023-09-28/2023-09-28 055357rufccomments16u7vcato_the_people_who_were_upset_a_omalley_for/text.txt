It’s smart, gain experience and build notoriety without putting yourself at risk. Is it annoying? Yes. Do I want to see it emulated with other prospects? Hell No. would I do it if I was in Sean’s shoes? Probably.

I mean people stopped saying he wasnt worthy after the Yan fight, it was fair to be skeptical before that

I’m happy he became champ but at the time and still now I don’t think that was the right outcome

His path was completely logical tbh. It was only weird cause they were hyping him so much from the get-go.

As they should have. He's a ridiculous character and fun to watch. Cringe AF but totally self aware and an ace at promoting himself.
