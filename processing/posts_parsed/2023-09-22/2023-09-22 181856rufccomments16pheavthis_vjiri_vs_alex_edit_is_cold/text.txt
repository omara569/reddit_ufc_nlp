    You can see Jiri being 100% in the moment during his walkout, taking it all in.

    This is gonna be a tough fight for me to watch. They are both among my favorite active fighters and it's gonna be sad to see one of them lose. That said, I like jiri more because I watched him in rizin for years. Still can't believe the king mo loss.

    Jiri is like one of those nerds that goes larping in the woods for a long weekend. Except unlike the larpers he could actually take out my whole family tree with his bare hands.

    This fight has some real Tekken/mortal Kombat vibes

    I love Alex and have become a huge fan of his over his ascension to the top.. but I cannot wait to see Jiri back in the cage. Dude brings a different type of energy to fights, makes them feel more meaningful.
