Do you realize Sean is satirizing athletes in the exact same way the movie is? He has done this in a few interviews and its more obvious, its why he smirks and Chris Curtis laughs. Deep cut though bruh.

I'm not dissing Sean I've been rooting for him for a while. But when I was listening to that interview and heard that part I was like "Where have I heard this before"..

I love how this subreddit can't decide whether or not sean is a satire master that is fucking with everyone with the shit he says or he's a really genuine guy that means everything he says
