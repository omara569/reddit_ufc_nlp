Just a freshly reminder than Jones ducked Ngannou for 3 years, wait for him to leave, and Ngannou 👑 is the real king of heavyweights

It’s the UFC’s fault, don’t blame Jon or Francis.

Dana publicly criticised Jon for wanting ‘Deontay Wilder type money’ to fight Francis. If there’s anyone who deserves it, it’s Jon.

The UFC wasn’t willing to pay Jon his asking price, and they weren’t willing to give Francis his concessions either. Simple as

Dana is very smart because he has people like you blaming fighters and not the actual UFC.

Ngannou effectively retired from competitive mma. That’s not Jones' fault. Ngannou has now got a new job doing something slightly different, but it pays more. Good for him.

I agree 100%. Neither of these guys were afraid. The UFC offered Francis what he was worth to them and he decided to move on. It’s that simple.

Jon wasnt afraid, neither was Francis. Blame the UFC for not paying them their worth instead of smearing fighters

Here's a "freshly" reminder that your post sucks

Imo Jones will never fight Francis, the money and the "preparation" for heavyweight was the perfect excuse for him to beat Cyril and old man Stipe and ride off into retirement
