Jan also picks banger walkout songs. Dragonborn theme with the Ankalaev fight and the one from that King Arthur film by Guy Ritchie.

Bro I was rooting or Ank until that Dragonborn song hit, never have I rooted for someone else so quickly.

Jan is just halirious for no damn reason.  Also terrifying at the same time.

The cigarettes and coffee diet callout to Izzy is pretty funny and pretty intentional.

To be honest LHW isn't the best division in terms of skill but all the top fighters all seem to be really nice guys.

Jan, Jiri, Alex or even Jamahal looks like a very nice guy to hangout with.

Let's not forget he got to star in a movie when he was champ too

Jan vs Pereira 2 - but this time they're competing in archery.
