    A sleeper banger of a fight night. Main event is going to be lit. Yanez vs Martinez is going to be non stop action. Rodriguez vs Saimaan is super interesting. Elkins always brings it. It's criminal that Gutierrez is on the prelims, the guy is a straight up killer. And let's be real, nobody gives a shit about the co-main. Shame that the Pereira fight got cancelled.

    Pereira, even though he's getting demoted to UFC Vegas and fight #4 for missing weight.

    Legit was looking forward Pereira Vs Barriault the most. Petroski is an excellent replacement, but that first fight was going to be guaranteed fireworks between two wild men. Petroski fights can be fun, but thereâ€™s no guarantee, and thereâ€™s absolutely the possibility that he just dominates this in a one sided showing.
  
    In lieu of it, Rodriguez Vs Saaiman is probably the one Iâ€™m interested in the most. Martinez Vs Yanez SHOULD be good, but I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if both guys try and play it safe.
