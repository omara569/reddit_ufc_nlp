Pitbull Bros.? Sounds like something Adesanya would google.

The Pitbull Bros are two famous fighters in Bellator. This is the gym they founded. Has close ties with Henry Cejudo’s Gym. Since Henry Cejudo went down there to train with their Karate Coach Mano Santana (which is where he developed the base of his current striking style). The old striking coach of the Pitbull Bros gym also now works at Henry Cejudo’s Gym in the US.
