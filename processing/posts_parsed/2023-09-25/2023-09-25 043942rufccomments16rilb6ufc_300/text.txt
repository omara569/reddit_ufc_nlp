UFC 300
Since everyone is posting their dream card, here’s my go at it. Considering the timeline of all fighters. These seem feasible and the fight outcomes are meaningful.        It would be nice if Sergei and Tom could also fight on the upcoming Jone’s card. That would make the HW fight even bigger.        What would you change?

    UFC site. You can make yours there, but if I see you taking any of my fights, I will find you 😝

    Dana will have to break the bank. And I am sure Jon would agree if the number is too good to say no to. Not everyone is Khabib who walked into sunset.

    Dana not gonna let Ian Garry anywhere near Shavkat for foreseeable future in my opinion. Shavkat will choke out his next Irish poster boy and ruin that cash cow.

    I don’t know, man! Shavkat was getting tagged by Geoff and struggled to take him down. He has almost no head movement, and I have seen him get floored outside the UFC.
  
    I think people are slightly overestimating Shavkat and slightly underestimating Garry.
  
    But I want this fight because the winner is a clear contender and perhaps one fight away from fighting for the title.
