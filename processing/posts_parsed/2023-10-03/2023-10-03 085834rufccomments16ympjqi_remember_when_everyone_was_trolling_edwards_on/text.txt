I remember when everyone was trolling Edwards on social media with the « 3 pieces and a soda »… Now that Masvidal never been champ like Leon, the same persons that were trolling Edwards are calling Jorge a bum LOL… some casual

    That's cause the more the spotlight shone on Jorge, the bigger the asshole he became. Yeah.. The losses doesn't help. But people didn't sour on him simply because of that.

    I wouldn’t consider masvidal a bum. People confuse out of rings antics with actual career and while he’s certainly a journeyman, he’s not a bum.
