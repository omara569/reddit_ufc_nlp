This dude looks like a villain in a C-rated fight movie, and not even the top antagonist either. Like, if they remade Bloodsport, he'd be the Muay Thai dude that Jean Claude fights in the quarterfinals, or maybe the sumo that got punched in the dick.

Fighting out of Bethlehem. Jesus “The Holy Spirt” of Nazareth. Professional record 0-1 against some stiff competition. Really got nailed in his last outing.
