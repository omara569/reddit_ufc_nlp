    I just hope Volk donâ€™t underestimate Islam because of the first fightâ€¦ In my opinion Islam looked drained in the first fight Iâ€™ve watched it a million timesâ€¦ I believe in Volk the man is a beast but I also believe Islam is going to be on point this time aroundâ€¦ how could you not love this sport man

    This is terrible for Volk. Dude was prepping for a featherweight bout. He's going to go into this one even lighter than the last, with a shorter camp against an elite wrestling specialist, coming off elbow surgery.
  
    I'm sure he's getting paid and pretty penny and he's not getting any younger, so I suppose he wants that final short at double-champ.

    The thing that concerns me is why did volk choose to fight now when he's not prepared 100% for it and probably won't get a 3rd fight with islam if he looses

    Its short notice for Islam too. Volks a completely different fighter from Charles so whatever gameplan they cooked is thrown out the window

    To be fair, itâ€™s possible. Heâ€™s probably been preparing for a rematch with Islam around the clock, while Islamâ€™s been focused on Charles. Weight cut should be extremely easy for Volk too

    As a Volk fan, his weight I think worries me the most. Like Volk fought if FW and his next fight was in FW, so I think he wonâ€™t have been bulking to be a good size on fight day and will be undersized

    Itâ€™s a win win for Volk because itâ€™s on 11 days notice. He wins heâ€™s a legend he loses didnâ€™t have enough time to prepare. I believe itâ€™ll be a close fight

    I donâ€™t know, if he loses to Islam for a second time, despite being in 11 days notice, I donâ€™t see the UFC giving him a third crack at it ðŸ¥²

    Volks is always training. Plus Islams camp was around Charles not Volk.
  
    They both have 10 days to prepare for each other
