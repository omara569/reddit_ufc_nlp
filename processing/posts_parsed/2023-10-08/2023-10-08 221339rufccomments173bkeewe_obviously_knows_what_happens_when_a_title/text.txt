We obviously knows what happens when a title fight ends in a draw. But what about a Title Unification Fight? Would the Interim Champion STILL be recognized as Interim?

    No... Because the way interims work is that they are invalidated THE MOMENT the bells rings in an undisputed title bout. Interim legitimately mean "in the meantime"... It's designed to be a stop-gap while the champion is out... It's also supposed to signify the rightful next challenger, so there shouldn't really be a time where an interim title is "being defended".
  
    Though if an interim and undisputed champ go the distance and it ends in a draw, there is a 99.9% chance they run it back immediately, so it doesn't matter.

    interim belts invalided the moment the bell rings
  

    Don't think thats true, they're both considered champs. Evidence: when olives fought gaethje he was champ up until the bell rang, when the fight started the graphic with his name reflected that he was no longer champ, showing a number ranking. But when khabib vs gaethje happened both names had C for champ instead of a ranking number

    Have they ever done a fight where one fighter is already interim champ and the other fighter is a contender? And they are still fighting for the interim belt? If that is a draw does the interim champ retain the belt?
