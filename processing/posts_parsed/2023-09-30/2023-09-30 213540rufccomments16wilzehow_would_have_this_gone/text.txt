    The narrative was always “tony is a bad matchup for khabib” but I think it’s the opposite, we’ve seen tony get taken down and controlled, guard passed In multiple fights (both early on in his career in the middle and obviously towards the end) Kevin lee mounted him but faded, even Danny Castillo was able to take him down and control him at times.
  
    Khabib isn’t getting caught in a dance from the bottom or a sub from rubber guard, he simply takes him down or tony rolls/pulls guard and khabib controls him and rides side control and mount until he wins a decision or even possibly gets a late sub himself.

    Tony would’ve thrown sand in Khabibs eagle vision to take away his one attribute he leans on and then different day same story it’s Tony time CSO

    Khabib squeezes the life out of him on the ground like a boa constrictor suffocating its lunch

    I think Tony would have had a good chance the first time they were supposed to fight.

    I don’t see it, khabib isn’t getting caught in a darce or getting triangled. He simply passes guard and rides out in side control

    Depends on which one didn't get cancelled. The earlier Tony fought Khabib, the higher his chances would have been. But I'd say only the first time he would have won.
