    The moment someone uses emojis in an argument, they automatically lose.

    Prime khabib could probably wrap him up, but prime mike always has the explosiveness to KO him
  
    I would have khabib though

    Really? This debate was already settled in UFC 1.
  
    If you don't have any grappling whatsoever, you have a very slim chance of beating someone that does.
  
    Royce Gracie was choking out guys twice his size and his grappling wasn't even tested much in the UFC by other world class grapplers. Imagine how much Khabib, a guy who makes other world class grapplers look like newbies, would maul Tyson who has zero grappling.
  
    A prime Royce Gracie would beat prime Tyson's ass but prime Khabib would victimize prime Tyson.
  
    It would be the trippiest thing you've ever seen, Tyson looking like a baby brother getting bullied by big brother, even though he's the bigger man.

    I mean, the weight gap is way too massive and Tyson has some raw power and serious experience as well. I would favour him to be honest.....

    Thats fair, I donâ€™t have an issue with anyone thinking Mike wins, itâ€™s just some of the things this guyâ€™s saying that are cringe, like, Mike beats Luke rockhold, mike would just stand up or if it goes to the ground mike kills him with the kind of violence not allowed in MMA ect.
