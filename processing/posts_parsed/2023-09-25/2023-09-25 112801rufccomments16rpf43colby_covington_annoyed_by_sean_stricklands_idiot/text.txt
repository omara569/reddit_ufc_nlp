    Sean is actually a crazy person whoâ€™s authentic imo, whereas Colby had to start acting like it to save his career

    Colby salty because sean is everything he wants to be. Funny, liked by the fans, respected by most colleagues and a champion in his sport.

    You forgot the most important part:
  
    Sean doesn't have to put on an act. He achieved this just being himself.
  
    That's the part that hurts anybody in Colby's position the most.
