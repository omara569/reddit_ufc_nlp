An All-Time great in his division facing a highly-touted rising contender in his "hometown".        -UFC 234 : Melbourne, Australia -UFC 294 : Abu Dhabi        Obviously, Kamaru and Anderson are not on the same dynamic in their career, not even comparable.        But this fight could be compared to a passing of torch.        With different styles in these oppositions, on October 21st, we'll see something great happening and I can't wait for that.        What are tou thoughts on that ?Kamaru Usman vs Khamzat Chimaev gives me Anderson Silva vs Israel Adesanya vibes ...

    Yes, I clarified that, all the kept proportions. Usman is still at elite level, not comparable to Silva at that moment. Though, the vibe is the same for me.

    Usman just lost two fights and everybody's like his heydays are far gone, dude's an amazing resume and is not somebody to count out. Since it's short notice I don't give him much chance either but an Usman with a full camp is always something to avoid for everybody. Mma community just remembers your last fight, this is how it is...

    For me it's a 50/50. Context more favourable for Chimaev but we can't deny that Usman is way closer to the end of his career than the begining. He was 34 when he got his last win. He is 36 now. Father time comes for everyone....

    You think ? I hope we'll see a great match though. If Chimaev wins that, it will be a kind of situation where a GOAT is passing the torch to a new phenom. I'll never disrespect Usman bro. This is how I see it lol

    Thereâ€™s no way Chimaev is capable of the respect Israel showed Anderson
