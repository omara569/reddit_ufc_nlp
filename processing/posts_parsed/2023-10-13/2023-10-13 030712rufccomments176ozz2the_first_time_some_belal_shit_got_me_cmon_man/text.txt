Nah topuria is good. Volk already confirmed that he'll be good to go again in January after his upcoming rematch. Unless he is severely injured or something, volk is a man of his word.

None of these guys deserve a title shot.

Topuria has gone radio silent since he squared off with Volk and Volk has way better things to do up at 155. Topuria should fight Max next, maybe then.

DDP only had a title shot against Izzy. Without him there is nothing there. Fight Izzy, maybe then. Usman or Chimaev is so much better. Either guy with the win over the other is better than DDP.

Name slipped my mind, sorry brother itâ€™s Colbyâ€™s time to shine. Colby is the way. Stay busy.

And idk who that fourth guy even is.
