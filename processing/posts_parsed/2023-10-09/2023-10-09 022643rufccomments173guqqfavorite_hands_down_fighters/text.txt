    The fighters I look forward to watching the most would probably be Justin Gaethje, Khazmat Chimaev, Jon Jones, Prochazka, Charles Oliveira, Yair Rodriguez, Topuria, Sean O'Malley, Volk. I also think Buckley puts on some good fights. Match all of them up with an exciting opponent, and that would make a üî• fight card. (I'd personally like to see Topuria matched with Pimblett, but Paddy would duck that fight)
