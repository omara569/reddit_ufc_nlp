Godspeed, Wonderboy. We should all be so brave.

    Dana tries to make Wonderboy seem like a bitch for not fighting Pereira, and then he goes out and takes a fight against Shavkat.

    WB vs Usman was the fight to make but he pissed off the UFC by letting it out that he wasn't paid his show money and now they want to bury him

    Could also be that Wonderboy knows beating Shavkat is the only way he'll get another run at the title.

    Wow. Sometimes it feels like Wonderboy wants to pick his opponents carefully and sometimes it feels like he'll fight anyone. Guess he figures this win will get him one last title shot.

    That's my line of thinking. The one weakness that Shavkat has is that his defense is kinda weak. He tends to absorb a lot of shots. When you have as good a striker as Wonderboy, you have to have better defense than that.

    He's my favorite fighter I honestly hope he wins this ( VERY unlikely ) and then calls for the title for one last time üôèüèª
