Disregarding how you feel about Stipe, how confident are you in Jon's ability at heavyweight in general or vs. Aspinall/Sergei? Even though he got a great result against Ciryl I feel like most of our questions were left unanswered. His last fight longer than 2 minutes was over 3.5 years ago now.

    He’s gonna beat stipe and retire.
  
    Honestly this whole situation kind of pisses me off. We should be getting Jones and Francis. But what we’ve gotten instead is Jon beating up an old Stipe, and Francis going off to get knocked out in a boxing match with Tyson fury.
  
    That Floyd/Conor fight really did fuck with both MMA and Boxing.

    I think people just ignore how slow and awkward Jon looked before the takedown and sub, admittedly it was short and didn’t matter but it was almost laughable…….. we have zero idea how Jon is at HW with this new weight

    I was gonna comment the same thing but just left it up to y'all. But yeah Jon didn't look good on the feet to me. It sounds ridiculous because it was one minute but it's all we have so far.

    I thought Ciryl was gonna smoke him tbh. But I won’t doubt him again after that one lol.

    Jones would get pimp smoked by Sergei and or Aspinal
  
    It is why he is fighting Stipe now.
  
    Not even the biggest of Jones nutthuggers would argue that Stipe deserves a title shot over Sergei
  
    Jones wanted to move to HW for like a decade and had to wait at the end of it for Francis to leave. Gane was taken down over and over by Ngannou with two fucked knees. Jones knew he could take him down. How couldn't he? lol
  
    jones pulled a GSP basically in terms of moving up when there was a champ you knew you could beat, in the case of Jones Gane was a perfect matchup for him and he knew he could divert the sporting aspect of the UFC and give Stipe the next title shot lol

    I think both Aspinall and Sergei would have a very competitive fight with Gane.
  
    Jon ran through Gane like he’s never fought before.

    I have no problem with Jon getting his "legacy" fight and then retiring. Don't really care to see him agains Aspinall/Sergei. I would love to see him beat them though just to get another lick of tasty saltiness from this sub
