    Sand shoveling is the best mma background

    The first few seconds Francis came out very patient and measured. Then when he took those leg kicks he started throwing nukes lol

    I know it’s a meme but you make it seem like he just dropped the shovel and entering the octagon.
  
    Ngannou had been boxing since age 22 and was about 35 in this fight. That’s 13 years of training and experience.

    Thats really late in terms of starting out in ANY combat sport.
  
    Just for reference:
  
    Oliveira fought Jim Miller at 22.
  
    Aldo fought for a WEC title eliminator at 22.
  
    Jones beat Bonnar at 22.
  
    The more important thing than that IMO is that Francis is a genetic freak lol.

    Ngannou power walking while windmilling his arms at you is the stuff of nightmares

    Biggest factor in life is luck. You can train kickboxing for decades with the best coaches, best diet and best techniques. But it means zilch when the man gifted with touch of death walks in.

    My 20 years of experience let me land 3-4 flush counters in the span of a nanosecond, but they did FOOKIN NUTHIN.
