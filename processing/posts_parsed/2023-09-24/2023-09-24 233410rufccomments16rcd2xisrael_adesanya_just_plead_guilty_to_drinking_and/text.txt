    Izzys trying to be just like Jon Jones fr. Incident occurred August 19th. In training camp for his 1st defense of his 2nd title run and decided to drive intoxicated
  
    “I want to apologise to the community, my family and my team for the decision I made to get behind the wheel after drinking at dinner,” Adesanya said in a statement provided to the Herald.
  
    “I was pulled over and gave an evidentiary blood test - the reading was 87 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.”
  
    “I am disappointed with my decision to drive, It was wrong.
  
    “I know that people might follow me and I want them to know I do not think this behaviour is acceptable.”

    Thats like just barely above the BAC level of 0.08% legal limit. Its equivalent of having 2 beers and a lot of people drink wine while eating out or some shit. This is basically a nonstory.
  
    Only reason people will make some of it is simply because its Izzy though.
