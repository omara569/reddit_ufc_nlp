No contest aside, dude really finished Nick Lentz 3 times

I think Charles and Tito Ortiz are the only people to do that in a UFC trilogy. Poor Lentz 😭

Love his style and how it has evolved through the years

Imagine Charles could also wrestle along with his Elite BJJ. He'd be unstoppable.

Any info on why the first Lentz fight was a NC? I was looking at his record the other day and wondering; for reference I’ve only been a “can’t miss an event” fan for the last two years

The first clip shown in that Lentz segment is Charles throwing an illegal grounded knee to Lentz’s head and went on to choke him, ref didnt notice it was illegal. Bruce Buffer announced it was a submission win. The crowd chanted “bullshit” and Joe Rogan said they’ll look to overturn it afterwards, Charles profusely apologized during the octagon interview

He has 31 MMA finishes, is it the world record?



Monric replied at 2023-09-29T22:09:59.531000+0000:



Most UFC finishes and prob more than any mma finishes out of any UFC fighter. But i think the world record is Travis Fulton 255-54-10-1, 247 finishes.
