I just can’t imagine being such good friends with someone to outright hating one another. These guys seemed to be the best of friends to getting into street fights and facing charges. Kinda sad, life is shortThis is actually kinda sad

I just read up about it.

Masvidal's coaches took Colby in and paid for him to train with them. When Colby started getting good, he started talking trash about Woodley and Mike Brown to sell himself in the UFC.

Not sad, Colby is a scumbag and deserves the hate.

Yeah it's sad shit. Rest in knowing Colby the dickhead practically wasted his prime, and is about to turn 36 this new year. Then look up the statistics on age and championship belt holders and their defense record.
