If they over turn this then I say over turn anyone who got a win during the TRT era.

Jones early run opponents were all roided up as hell

Dude fought prime TRT Vitor

DCs test levels were also clearly suspect

I'm convinced that Jon has lied for so long that he now 100% firmly believes all his lies

To be fair on Jones the levels he popped for in that fight would no longer constitute a positive test.

He probably did it but he at least has a point about the rules being inconsistent.

At the time though it did constitute a positive test hence the ruling should not change.
