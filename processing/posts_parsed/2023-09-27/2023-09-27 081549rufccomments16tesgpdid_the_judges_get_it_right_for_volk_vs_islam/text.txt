Did the Judges get it right for Volk vs Islam?

    I think so. Most people scored it 48-47 to Islam, but obviously a lot of vocal people disagree.

    I think Islam won 1,2,4 and Volk won 3 and 5.
  
    If Islam hadn't taken Volk's back I think he would have likely won Round 4 too, Volk seemed to have the cardio advantage late (and he also was less afraid of the takedowns so he was doing better on the feet). But ultimately the back position definitely secured Islam the round.
  
    Rounds 1 and 2 were competitive but Islam landed the better shots and got some takedowns in addition to that. Round 2 was kinda close but I still give it to Islam.
  
    Round 3 I think Volk landed better but it's close too. Round 5 Volk dropped Islam so it's definitely his round.
  
    I think people that think Volk should have won are just biased because of the end of the fight. It's true that in the end Makhachev was the fighter that was in worse condition but this is round by round scoring and a 5 Round fight. That's just the game.
  
    You can feel that Islam won the "game" but Volkanovski won the "fight" and that's fine.

    There was nothing controversial about the scorecards for this fight. Volk did well when no one expected him to and gave Islam such a close fight that some people wanna give him a little extra leniency and claim he got screwed when he didn't. Often happens when a dominant fighter comes across a fighter that actually gives them a run for their money

    Huge Volk fan. On the night I thought he lost.
  
    Rewatched today as free on YouTube, still think he lost.
  
    I had it 48-47 but R3 is super close not even annoyed with 49-46!

    Yes. Except tht 49-46 wtf was that. Other than that Islam won but it was a super close fight.

    I honestly do not understand why anyone but volks fans would even give him round 5.
  
    Prior to that final minute, in the 5th, Islam was dominating volk.
  
    He caught volk coming in twice, making volk back off and acknowledge the shots.
  
    He took volk down twice.
  
    On two separate occasions, knee'd volk in the head and face, opening a gash by volks eye the second time.
  
    I just don't see that volk having top control for the final minute could offset all of that.  He wore himself out getting on top, and didn't land much of shit during that whole entire 60 seconds.

    Only thing that was bad about the fight is being rewarded for hugging and not advancing position but that isn't unique to this fight.

    Yes, even if you didn't watch the fight you can see the fight was close based on the stats, Volk had his best success in the last round and clearly won that 1 with 20 significant strikes. I think the ground control of Islam is important as is the location the significant strikes landed (head and body vs leg). Ultimately I think Islam won at least 3 of the 5 rounds. Having watched the fight more than once I had Islam as the clear winner in a very competitive fight
