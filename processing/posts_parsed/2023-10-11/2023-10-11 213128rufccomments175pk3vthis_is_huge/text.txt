And winner of Izzy-DDP (unconfirmed but makes sense) fights for the belt after that?

Imagine telling someone earlier in the year that Usman could be fighting Strickland for the MW title lmao

Ngl would rather the winner of Usman and khamzat fight for belt, then dricus and if he wins then fights adesanya.

The only reason he was getting a shot was because of Israel and that African stuff he said. Without that I donâ€™t see why ufc gives him a title shot
