Who you got? Potentially one of the best matchups to make at welterweight, if you were Belal would you take this fight or sit out for a title shot?
I think Belalâ€™s title shot is long overdue but this would definitely be a great fight.

    Nothing to gain everything to lose for Belal

    This is assuming that belal can just sit and wait for a title shot. I do think he's earned it but I dont think Dana will give it to him for sitting and waiting. Would (should) earn title shot beating usman.

    I see this going the Dariush route.
  
    Doesn't wait for the title, fights the previous champ, gets schooled.
  
    Winstreak broken, gets removed from title-shot discussions.

    Fuck all of that. Belal should be next no matter what even if it's an interim shot if the champ is out for a while. Colby is getting his 4th shot in 7 fights when his most recent win against a top 5 WW is 5 years ago against RDA. It's god damn ridiculous. Colby's biggest career accomplishment is losing two close fights to Usman whom the current champion beat twice.
  
    I'm not saying Colby can't win, but him getting to go in front of Chimaev, Belal, and Shavkat is insane.

    Belal shouldn't fucking fight, he's earned it
  
    If he doesn't get the TS after then Dana is full of shit, man took a short notice fight and beat him, if he doesn't deserve the shot then I don't want to see anybody else whining about how x fighter doesn't deserve y.

    Could go to shavkat/Thompson winner. Belal definitely deserves it but nobody gets what is deserved especially at WW

    If everyone else in welterweight is gonna sit around do nothing and not fight then Belal might as well do the same and wait for his title shot
