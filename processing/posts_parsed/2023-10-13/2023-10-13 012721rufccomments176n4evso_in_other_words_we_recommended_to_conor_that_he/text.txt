So in other words “we recommended to Conor that he should take steroids to speed up his recovery, to make us big money sooner”

    Don't think that's the case. Use of peds for recovery is legit in my books for the most part. What bugs me is that 1) Someone like Chris Weidman did not get to enjoy the same dana white privilege. 2) Conor potentially gets to come back without the full 6 month testing period.

    Chris Weidman didn’t even know it was an option, I’m sure they would’ve let him if his management asked.
  
    He literally said it was too late to do it by the time he learned about Conor exiting the pool.

    Makes no sense. Get that Conor had to take drugs to speed recovery.
  
    But six months of testing is all he needed. Dude spent the last six months drinking.

    Just because Conor makes it seem like hes constantly partying doesn’t mean he is. You don’t stay in the kind of shape he’s in if all you’re doing is drinking.

    Way to comepletly ignore what he was saying, thats not even close to what he said
  
    And who gives a fuck is Conor is juicing while he has a severe injury. He should be on the best shit money can by so he can come back close to 100% as possible.

    Hunter and Jeff were all over the place in the interview.  At one point Hunter was telling us how a female on the roster had tested postive for a banned substance.  After He spent 2 hours with her, he came to the conclusion she tested positive because she was having sex with a guy who was on steriods.      Haha
