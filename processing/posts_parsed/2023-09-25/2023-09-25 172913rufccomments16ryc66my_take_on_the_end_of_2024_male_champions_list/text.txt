My take on the end of 2024 male champions list

    Bold to assume Jon Jones isn't gonna hold the belt hostage in 2024 like Francis did. Assuming he beats Stipe at least.

    If the UFC feed O Malley perfect matchups then maybe he stays champ, but if Merab gets his deserved title shot then I think Mrs 6ix 9ine is toast

    Not even merab, I think Cory, Vera and Petr Yan can defeat O'Malley.
