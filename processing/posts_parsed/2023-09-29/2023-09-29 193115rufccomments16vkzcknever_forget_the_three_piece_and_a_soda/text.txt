It‚Äôs fuckin ridiculous we never got closure to this. Extremely disappointing. How this wasn‚Äôt the next fight for both will always blow my mind

Yes and ate his ass after. Not even close

Massy got off easy

Maybe maybe not.. The Masvidal that was coming off the Askren KO and dismantling Nate Diaz was looking really strong and confident on the feet

That fight could have been a banger for real it‚Äôs a shame it never happened.

It always annoyed me that people glorified Masvidal for sucker punching Leon, especially when he refused to fight him afterwards.

Nah both fighters, both talking shit, both approached each other aggressively. Not a sucker punch.

What he did to Colby 100% sucker punch.
