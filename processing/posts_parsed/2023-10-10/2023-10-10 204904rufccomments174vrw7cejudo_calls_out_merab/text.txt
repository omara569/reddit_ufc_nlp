Cejudo calls out Merab
Henry Cejudo’s latest YouTube video. Henry and Merab have been offered to fight each other and Henry is waiting for Merab to sign.        He talks about the consequences of Merab sitting out or refusing to fight Aljo. With Cory and Umar coming back from injury in early 2024, Merab has no leverage by sitting out.

    I’m guessing he messed up the date, but he was talking about Ilia.
  
    They offered Henry vs Merab to be on the Volk vs Ilia card.

    The still frame this video starts at makes Cejudo look like a bleedin picasso.
