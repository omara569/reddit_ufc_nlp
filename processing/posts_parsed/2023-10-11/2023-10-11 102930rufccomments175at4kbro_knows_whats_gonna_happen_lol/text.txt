    Thats actually how he makes his own secret juice. Doing a bubbler after eating nothing but vegemite and bunnings snags through camp gives him powers.

    While it’s Volk choice to take the fight on such short notice, it will be a massive advantage for Islam having already done a full camp.
  
    I think a rematch of this magnitude should’ve took place at a later date when both men are at their best!

    Volk has been training for another islam fight this whole time. Basically his hobby

    The card was just too damned good to be true. Volk stepping in is great but Costa dropping out has left a dark hole in my stomach.
  
    I was looking forward to that fight the most but I just knew someone was pulling out.

    From what I saw...obviously just rumors...is that Costa is out of the fight.
  
    HOWEVER
  
    They did reach out to Marvin Vettori and he declined, so they are now focusing on doing what they can to get Robert Whittaker to replace him.

    I know this is the money fight but why rush into the rematch. Gamrot was the backup. While I want to see this fight more than Islam vs Gamrot. I wanted to see this rematch when both were at their absolute best.

    Everyone is forgetting gamrot was the backup. They should have tried calling gaethje too

    I think Volk was already prepping for this. Hence the later delayed signing of the Topuria bout.

    Don't forget Volkanovski is carrying the EA curse in n his back. At least his title isn't on the line
