If these 2 fought in their primes, who takes the W?

    Conor for sure dude was a sniper. Heâ€™d find that chin and KO Dan.

    how is this even a question?
  
    Prime Conor hit a level Dan was never close too.  Hooker is also not nate, hes very durable but he has been finished by strikes a number of times.

    As much as people like to shit on Conor, dude was a killer in his prime. He would end Hooker inside 2 rounds almost unscathed.

    Dan's striking is so slow it fucked other fighters timing up, he was so bad he was good. This is the only reason he ever won shit.

    One is a former champion. Another got beat by an offbrand bum half his height.

    Don't sleep on Conor because of his post-champ antics, he was an absolute killer in his prime. Sleeps him in round one or two.
