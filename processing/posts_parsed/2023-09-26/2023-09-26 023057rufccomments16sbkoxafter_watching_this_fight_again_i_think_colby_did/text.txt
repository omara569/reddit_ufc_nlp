After watching this fight again I think Colby did win 3 round to 2. If anything this was more of a draw than Valentina vs grasso 2

A completely valid and arguable viewpoint.

Have fun getting downvoted.

I think so. But let me call Dana to verify

I agree, a draw should have been fair imo.

Yeah Colby won this fight, but didn't win hard enough for the judges to not give it to the champion

It's like Sean said he needed to work on his optics to win his fights.  Now his coaches will scream out optics at the end of each round.  Colby needs to learn the optic game as well.

A draw is fair. I rewatched that fight a couple months ago and as an avid colby hater and it was really close and could see a world where the judges gave it to him instead . But i still think usman won . Rd 2 shouldve been a 10-8
