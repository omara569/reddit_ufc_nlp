Latest news on Paulo Costa. Apparently he wants to fight and only UFC medical holds the decision to allow him or not.

    If what costa says is true, and to me it sounds believable, why is everyone hating on him? Granted I love Costa's internet troll persona, so maybe that is clouding my judgement, but it seems unfair to hate him for this if UFC has known for a long while. If he was ready and cleared to fight by the time of the actual fight everyone would be calling him a savage.

    Well he knew of the injury/ surgery for at least 3 weeks.  Makes a video detailing the injury this week and also touches on how bad it is and it‚Äôs risky to fight with it and now is going to play the ol‚ÄùI‚Äôm down to fight but ufc doctors for some reason won‚Äôt clear me‚Äù

    I feel so bad for Costa fans. Imagine being captivated  by broken English twitter shitposting. Never gave a fuck if this dude was gonna fight or not, only ever cared about Khamzat.

    Costa is a disappointment. The UFC should not waste anymore time and cut him he has ruined to many fights

    Injuries are often accidentsü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
  
    The only thing that should be held against him is the weight issue

    "Don't hold me back bro, let me bang" meanwhile he's letting the world know he's been injured and had surgery which would almost certainly result in him being removed from the fight. Smh at this guy, he has a reputation of backing out of fights and at this point he should just be cut by the UFC

    I don't see anything wrong with this. The UFC knew when the surgery happened 3 weeks ago. The only thing that changed is as the fight gets closer I'm sure the doctors are weary of letting him fight and now Costa is going public because he doesn't want to be accused of pulling out or being scared

    The crowd saying he should be cut sound like scorned lovers. Serious problems in the heads of those guys. UFC company man mentality. Probably goons to Dana White press conferences.
