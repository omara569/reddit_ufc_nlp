    I watched that video. Nothing really revealing was said. He basically just said he was surprised Charles fell out and he is one of the few guys who would take this fight on such short notice.

    Also says that while he’s been in holiday mode and having a few beers 🤷🏻‍♂️ I love Volk and hope he wins but I feel like he’s going to be coming into this fight a bit under done.

    He already sounds like a beaten man with little confidence. He must have been covered in gold to accept the fight.
