    I thought O'Malley was alright. Now I think he's a good guy. I worked with that population for years. They were some of the best people I've had the honor to be around tbh. Despite their disadvantages, they were kind, accepting, and loving. Stuff like this really brightens their lives up. They will always remember him now. If you notice, it didn't take too much for him to be human. More people should act like this, even if they do the whole weird Tekashi69 get-up

    It was on his Snapchat. He stayed for hours! It was not just a photo op. He and Tim are just good people. Apparently Sean worked with disabled people before fighting

    He said thatâ€™s what heâ€™d still be doing if he wasnâ€™t fighting
