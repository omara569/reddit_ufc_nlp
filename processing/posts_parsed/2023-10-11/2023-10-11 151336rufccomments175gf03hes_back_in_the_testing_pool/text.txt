    I still can’t believe that USADA stole all this time from us with Conor. They definitely reduced the number of fights he has left by at least 1 and that’s such a shame.

    Who cares? We all knew the Irish clown took juice for mad long to repair that gimp leg of his. He's a piece of trash as well. I'm only watching his next fight to hopefully see him get Koed. Conor is human garbage through and through.
