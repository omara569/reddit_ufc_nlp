Do you guys think Khabib will corner Islam this time? Abu Dhabi is a short trip and he probably has bidness to conduct there anyway.

    Khabib is not the type to play favorites with his crew, if he corners Islam he will feel obligated to corner Umar, Usman, etc etc. Usman has a fight this Friday and Khabib won’t even be in the country, that’s his own cousin.

    I believe in an interview, islam said khabib is a man of his word and sense he said he won't be coaching ever again outside of maybe just giving his team tips i believe it. He wants to spend all the time he puts into coaching with his family and let the fighters like islam make a name for themselves without him being there.

    I forgot which interview I saw but Khabib will be at Abu Dhabi, give Islam a little bit of tips but will not be on his corner. Probably on a spectator seat.

    i think as time goes on khabib is going to move away from all this more and more...he is a deeply spiritual person and also a family man and that is more important to him than anything and he has all the money and such he needs. I get the sense that he loves his people and wants to help them succeed and all but really he would rather move to some mountain and spend his life in quiet contemplation or some shit at this point. I mean shit, can't blame him

    I think he doesn't like the fact that everywhere he goes, even as a coach, all the attention is on him instead of the fighters. Even in their post fight speeches they give him all the credit and cheer the loudest for him.
