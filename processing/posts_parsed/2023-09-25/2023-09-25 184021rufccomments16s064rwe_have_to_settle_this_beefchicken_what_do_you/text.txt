    Well i prefer chicken over beef, but you know what's better? Chicken with rice or a steak with mashed potatoes, herese the thing, you'd always go for the steak, but you can't eat steak every day to the level you can eat chicken which would lead me to conclude that chicken has a stable longterm class while beef has higher highs but doesn't live up to expectations in the long run.
