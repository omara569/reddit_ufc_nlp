Tbh Jiri vs Alex looks very promising. Im satisfied with that matchup.

While Iâ€™m excited, Iâ€™m also nervous. Two of my favorite fighters. This is going to be a WAR

I want to see Johny Walker beating Ankalaev so we have Pereira vs Walker. This would be so funny

If Ngannou beats Francis does that mean Pereira beats Alex?

Left hook is a perfect counter to left hook. This is a dream match up.
