    Francis probably doesnt do well in sparring cus he has to hold back some power or he would have no sparring partners left

    yeah that's true but also if he's using his power in sparring he's not going to get better

    I knew Doumbe was the real deal when he took the belt off Holzken when he was only 24. Kickboxing fans know how dominant Holzken was back then.
