    My anxiety and disappointment would be at an all time high, if my kid told me he planned on pursuing a career in fighting.

    It might sound cold for him to say that but he's doing the kid a favor.

    Treat it as a hobby unless you get good at it, then go hard is what he really meant. All the same it's a really weird encounter being asked that question

    Am I insane, or have his takes gotten remarkably better since he won the belt? I'm sure the dude still has some issues, but he seems a little more reasonable as of late.
