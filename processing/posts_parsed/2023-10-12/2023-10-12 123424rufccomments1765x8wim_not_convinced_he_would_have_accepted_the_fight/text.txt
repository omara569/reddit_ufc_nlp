I'm not convinced he would have accepted the fight

Whether he would or not of course they bring in Usman to fight Chimaev. Their goal is getting Chimaev as champion. Fighting Bo right now doesn’t help him. Whichever guy lost would be derailed and retroactively made into someone who was always not that good. And whichever guy won you jerks would completely dismiss by saying he fought someone that was over hyped.

You can’t do that now. Usman is as legit as they come. So if Chimaev wins he just beat a legit badass you guys can’t deny. And if Usman wins he proved he’s back and able to defeat the young lions. This fight is perfect.

Bo will get his shot later.

Solid explanation I’m beginning to think you’re not the real Dana white

The UFC considered him for that fight just as much as they considered me.

Beating Khamzat on short notice would put Nickal close to a title fight and would give him absurd amounts of hype, and if he loses no one would really hold it against him because he's only 5 fights into his career and it was short notice. Dude would go from unranked prospect with some hype to a possible next title challenger.

It's very low risk and incredibly high reward and any fighter in his place would take that fight
