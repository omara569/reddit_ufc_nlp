I don't think Shogun is talked about enough
Won the Grand Prix in Pride and had some legendary fights there. Then came over to the UFC, found his feet and eventually won the LHW title.        He was and is one of my favourite fighters of all time. Where do you rank Shogun Rua, do you think he's talked about enough?

    Just recently saw the clip of him vs Chael Sonnen in 2013. I forgot they fought. Even more surprised Chael submitted him in round one. But actually, not in an ‚Äúundefeated, undisputed‚Äù way Chael actually tapped him out first round.

    Beyond the memes, Chael was a beast. Nobody else managed to do to prime Silva what he did to Prime Silva.
  
    He lost that match, but he won that fight.

    His run in Pride was legendary, but his UFC run wasn't. IIRC, he has the record of UFC champion with most losses
