Remember when Shane Carwin beat the ever loving hell out of Brock Lesner and then lost?

I’ve been a big mma guy since the early 2000s and, while I don’t think they should let it go as long as they used to back then, there is a higher number than there should be of moments now where I feel they have an itchy trigger finger and are too quick with the TKO calls.

Any ref other than Josh Rosenthal and any other fighter than Brock Lesnar taking the beating and that fight would have been stopped.

Exactly. They needed the money man to win but Shane can feel good knowing he was the better fighter that day. It should have been stopped.

I’m sorry man I hate Brock as much as the next guy but Shane did not finish that fight, and Brock did. That’s the game. So do we take away franks win as well or any of the other numerous fights where guy gets “beat up” but wins the fight? The fuck are you talking about? Gracie wouldn’t stand a chance with you fans

The more I watch it, the more I feel like it wasn’t unreasonable to keep it going. There’ll always be an asterisk, but Brock really only shelled up and looked done for a few seconds of the beating. He was doing his best to stay in there for most of it, and ended up weathering the storm.

No asterisk, am I in bizarro land where Carwin got robbed what the fuck is this echo chamber

Just went back and watched it.

Yeah Brock took a ton of damage, and in a fight these days it would probably be stopped…

But that doesn’t negate the fact that the fight kept going and once round 2 started Brock looked beat up but Carwin was obviously gassed as hell and had nothing left in the tank.

Brock got the submission fair and square.

Only Carwin fight I really remember was when he knocked out frank mir in like :30.  My buddy sheepishly admitted he bet $350 on mir right before it started.  Laughed so hard when he got slept
