Alex and Danis would make a good buddy comedy. Just two completely different people. Alex, the stoic, Greek God of few words and the weasely, POS immature jokester.

If they made that movie you know Pereira would be played by The Rock.  Danis can be Kevin Hart.

Danis is pretty much a troll only at this point but at least Alex could learn some Jits from him. Danis has some really good jiujitsu despite the fact he really does not fight anymore. I am sure he has kept his level up in the gym though

The guy made ADCC and gave Gordon Ryan a close match (granted this was 2017 way before his current peak). His bjj is very legit
