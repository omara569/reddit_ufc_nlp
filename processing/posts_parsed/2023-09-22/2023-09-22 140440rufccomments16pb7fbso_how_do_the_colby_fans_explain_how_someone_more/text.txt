So how do the colby fans explain how someone more controversial than him was able to win over the majority of the fan base? What excuse do you guys have now for nobody but yall liking colby? Maybe time to realize his shtick is just dumb?
Just find it hilarious that somebody was able to disprove that people didn't like colby because "everybody's woke"
