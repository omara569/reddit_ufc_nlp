    Yeah, these Monster UFC contests are surprisingly slept on, hence the odds of winning a legit prize are actually high.
  
    I won the second place prize (a $100 all purpose gift card) from the contest they ran last year.
  
    I entered it on a total whim too as I had to go inside of an AM/PM instead of just paying for gas at the pump.
