"I will be ready" Islam Makhachev training even harder  before the rematch with Charles Oliveira.

    I think Volkanovski may have screwed up Olivera's chance of blindsiding him in the rematch. Alex gave him a small taste of mortality so I just know he has been training like a monster since.

    That Volk fight has probably humbled Islam. Not that he wasn't humble before, but I think it's probably good for Islam to have some struggle to improve. If you're beating everyone easily, there is no reason to improve.

    That Volk fight is gonna make Islam even more dangerous, he said after the fight he underestimated Volk so if that fight hadn't happened I'm sure he'd have underestimated Charles in the rematch also cuz the first one was so easy for him. Can't underestimate anyone in the top 5.

    I love how there's been no build up vids of Charles or Islam. These two been training like mad men. Reckon it'll end in another sub, but will have some high quality stand up

    I respect that he's training still and not underestimating Charles despite dominating him.
  
    Maybe he didn't prepare enough for Volk and wrote him off due to his size and boyyy that wasn't a smart move.

    I think it's a mix of khabib leaving his camp suddenly, possible underestimation and an exceptionally short rehydration window

    Iâ€™m on Islam train but saying he will not be beaten by Charles is a massive oversight. A fortnight ago, nobody is saying Izzy will be dethroned by Strickland
