    Anime story arcs take forever so this makes sense.

    Came here to say this.  Dude was fighting like what 3-4 times a year? Long time off might mean like a year or less

    Time for the Adesanya time-skip arc.
  
    Let’s see how much he improves with training over the next 2 years.

    Honestly, he has always been super active and has earned a break. I’m for sure a fan but can’t stand him as a person. That being said, dude for sure has earned time off. Go do you, you weird son of a bitch.

    Respect to izzy for doing this. I was expecting him to rematch Strickland straight away. He is a workaholic and all of the guys that see behind the scenes say so. I think him taking this break will be good for him. Find his hunger and killer instincts again. It will be huge when he returns. Imagine the dudes who he could be fighting when he comes back. Kamzat? Bo? The up and coming contenders are all exciting fights.

    Izzy's level of activity over the last few years is impressive. He's done a LOT to keep the division moving. Even stepping away is keeping the division moving. Dead serious fighters like Kamaru, Izzy, and Amanda really made sure their divisions stayed front and center during their reign.
