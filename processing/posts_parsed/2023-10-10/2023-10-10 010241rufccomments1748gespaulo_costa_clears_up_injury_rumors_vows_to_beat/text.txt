    This doesn't mean anything Paulo is 100%, and will always be 100% coming into Abu Dhabi, and if Khamzat dominates, it'll be indicative of how their fight goes 100% of the time, I don't care.

    Anti biotics aren't fun. He will probably not be 100%
  
    This is just a sad setup for what was in theory a great fight with all the right ingredients.
  
    Costa is not consistent.
  
    Ideally he wouls drop the meme life, get professional management and be more serious about his career.
  
    But this is easier said than done. And it's easy for us to type these words not being there in his shoes.
