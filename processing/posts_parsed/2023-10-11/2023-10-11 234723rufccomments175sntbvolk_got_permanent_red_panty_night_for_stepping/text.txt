    This is how you get ahead and become a top star in the company, by being a company man and stepping up to fight. Not by whining like these other diva champions. Not be saying no to fights while holding the belt hostage. Not by ducking for 6 months, or pretending to be hurt. Take notes everyone. Volk is earning every single fucking dollar

    Itâ€™s actually baffling that the two guys who have stood up this week (Volk and Usman) are the two most active champions weâ€™ve had this decade.
