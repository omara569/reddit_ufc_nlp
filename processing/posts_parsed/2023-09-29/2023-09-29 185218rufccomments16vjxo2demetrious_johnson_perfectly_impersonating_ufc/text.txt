This Demetrious guy seems pretty good. The UFC should sign him. Might be some good talent for the lighter weight classes

He's up a weight class since leaving UFC at 125lb.

Just took gold at IBJJF in the 154lb class a few weeks ago, and he's currently the ONEFC 135lb champ.

That extra weight is all muscle, he's as shredded as ever.

Dj the type of freak athlete to imagine something and just make his body do it.
