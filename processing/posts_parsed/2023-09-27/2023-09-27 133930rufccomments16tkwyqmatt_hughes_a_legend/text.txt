Matt was THE fighter that got me interested in MMA. It was a shame to find out what a shitty human he was and even worse to see him get run over by a damn train. But he did get me interested in the sport.

He used to pound his twin brother behind the barn

I hated Matt Hughes so much that gsp got me really into ufc the first dude who could actually man handle that pos. " I am not impressed by your performance!"
