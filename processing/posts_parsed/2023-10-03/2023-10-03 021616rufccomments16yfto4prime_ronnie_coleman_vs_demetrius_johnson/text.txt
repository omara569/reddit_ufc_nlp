I am a huge ufc fan but I feel like ronnie would take it. He could throw demetrius like a bug and even if he held him he could probably squeeze him to death. What are your thoughts?Prime Ronnie Coleman vs Demetrius Johnson.

He would get 30–26'd by USADA before the fight even starts.

DJ just makes him move and miss for a round or two and then Ronnie collapses on his own

Prime Ronny was 300+ pounds on stage. I know it's a meme but I feel like Ronny would literally just be too big.

Not sure if you are serious or not but have you seen how much trouble Ronnie had breathing for just walking around back in the day?

DJ would make him pass out from exhaustion before the second round…..

DJ via Ronnie's heart attack

DJ dances around Ronnie while stabbing his hgh belly. Ronnie collapses from exhaustion after getting baited into swinging twice

Prime Ronnie Coleman would probably beat most heavyweights and probs easily beat DJ, Ronnie was actually freakishly athletic unlike Mr 260. He was also a cop an competed in boxing/powerlifting and did really well in track and field.
