    I'm still surprised the doc let Bryce continue there's no way he could see out of that eye

    He doesn't need eyes, the Lord does all his seeing for him 🤣

    I was questioning what the point was. His eye was sealed shut, she didn’t hold up fingers or anything. Just said “can you see?” And let him continue 😂

    They just label non-believers as afraid cos they’re frustrated not many people give a shit about their particular belief system

    This random dude, Matt Couch (who?), is just tweeting about what happened…I’m sure he’s religious and thought it was cool. I don’t even understand why we would care, or why OP even cares lol.
  
    As for Bryce, I’m all for him being himself. More people should be themselves in general. It’s always more interesting and real that way. He probably doesn’t need to say an entire formal prayer over the mic so I understand not doing that, but everything else he did was perfectly fine. A lot of pro fighters/athletes are religious…so be it. Let them do their thang as long as they genuinely compete.

    “I don’t know shit about fuck but someone prayed”. So inspiring.

    Considering this is the most attention Bryce has ever gotten, you can guarantee this will be his brand from here on out too.

    It's funny how in the UFC. The Muslims are the chill dudes.
  
    And the Christians are the opposite.
