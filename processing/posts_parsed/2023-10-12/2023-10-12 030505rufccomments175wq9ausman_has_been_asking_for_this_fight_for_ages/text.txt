Usman has been asking for this fight for ages. Y'all must have forgot. Prime Nightmare returns on Oct 21. Have a good night khamzat ðŸ¦ŠðŸ›Œ

    I hope he wins. It will be such a sad sight to see such a dominant champ to lose 3 times in a row.

    I think this is a no lose scenario for him. Worst case, he rolls off the coach and doesnâ€™t get the job done at a higher weight class against one of the phenoms of the sport + cashes out big time.  No bearing on his WW trajectory as such ( one win away from a title shot if Leon loses).
  
    Best case, he wins at gets a MW title shot against a guy heâ€™s beaten before

    I'll be rooting for him but I don't think either of them deserve a title shot off of this.

    Usman is a chad for stepping in but he got no knees. He's moving up. Khamzat is the bigger guy. Borz in rd 2.

    Dude just hates fighters from the Caucasus. All the repetitive spam posts are in favor of whoever is not remotely Russian.

    I'm hoping this will be as close as Volk vs Islam 1
