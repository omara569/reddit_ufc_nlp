Coldest McGregor edit

    What I wouldnâ€™t give to see this version of Conor in the octagon one last time. I was excited at the time, but sometimes I wish the Floyd fight never happened.

    Man the things I would do to see this mcgregor vs Khabib. He looked like he got some confidence back by beating old man cowboy but damn Khabib destroyed him

    Retrospectively this was peak McGregor. Untouchable and deadly with his striking. A shame how it all unfolded. Yes he made more money than any fighter in mma history, but his character and fighter ability were drastically affected.

    I like this one. Man why an iconic moment in this sport. McGregor was the peak any fighter could hope to become right about then.

    I read that as oldest McGregor edit. Someone put the same music on his more recent performances.
