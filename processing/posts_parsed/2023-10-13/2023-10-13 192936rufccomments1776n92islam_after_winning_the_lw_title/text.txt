Top 5 LWs were ducking and dodging for years. They deserve to be on ice for a while

This really only applies to Poirier if we’re honest

What does this mean, blame Oliveira the pull out merchant, why would Islam want to take a fight on a new short notice opponent he already beat, he's not gonna get credit for it anyways lmao

The only LW that had a clear claim to a title shot was Dariush and he fucked it up when he lost to Olivera, so Olivera took that title shot to himself and also fucked it up, yeah it was an accident but wear a fucking head guard when you’re few days away from a title shot you might bot get again.
