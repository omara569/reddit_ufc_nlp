Regarding ppv points, as the card will be stacked with fire co-main Alex Pereira vs Prochazka, and main event Bones vs Stipe, the only champ on the card is John Jones, so only one to get ppv points is John Jones.

For example if they put Leon there he would get a certain amount of money for every PPV bought  (let’s just say .25 USD per PPV, i no idea how much it actually is) and Jones Vs. Stipe could and probably will break 1 million buys so you’d have to pay Leon $250K in this scenario whereas with Alex Vs. Jiri neither guy is the champ so neither of them get money based on PPV sales.

I highly doubt Jones is the only one getting points. Alex is just as smart and was the one rumored to be paid 6 figures for his debut fight in the UFC. He understands his worth like the best of them. I'd imagine he is getting some cut as well.

Overeem was paid a dollar for every PPV purchased and he was never a champ.
