    Well this certainly doesnâ€™t answer any questions about how Khamzat does against the top MWs but good fight nonetheless

    It's actually fucking BOMB!
  
    The card is now 10 times better thanks to Oliveira and Costa pullouts.

    nice spin by uncle dana calling them both welterweights.
  
    chimaev cant make welter, we've been through this.
  
    So its a big ass MW against a WW on short notice. Im honestly not interested,  I wanted to see Chimaev against someone big, I have no interest in seeing him against another undersized opponent.
  
    DDP, Whitaker, Adesanya, Bo Nickel, Marvin - all those were better options.
  
    Enjoy that money Marty, cause this is gonna hurt.
