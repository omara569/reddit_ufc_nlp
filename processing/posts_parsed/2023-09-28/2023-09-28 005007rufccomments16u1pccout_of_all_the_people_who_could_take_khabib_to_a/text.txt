Out of all the people who could take Khabib to a decision, it was godamn Al Iaquinta. Insanity.

Styles make fights. That gym has a lot of freak grapplers like Merab, Weidman, Aljamain- good wrestlers with good hands.

All Al did was survive 25 minutes. Literally did nothing else

Let’s not act like this wasn’t more than a sparring match for Khabib

Before this fight, Khabib said he wants to feel all 5 rounds because a lot of people said that Khabib doesnt have a stamina for 5 rounds.

Khabib looked like was going through a sparring session.

And still technically did less impressive than others did. People think making it to a decision is automatically better than being finished, but it isn't.

Khabib literally used him as sparring practice for at least two rounds to test his stand-up skills. No one can imagine him doing that to McGregor, Poirier, or Gaethje without it biting him in the ass

Khabib was bored in there.

He was better off being finished. I have not seen a single opponent of Khabib this messed up in the face.

Barboza was worse.
