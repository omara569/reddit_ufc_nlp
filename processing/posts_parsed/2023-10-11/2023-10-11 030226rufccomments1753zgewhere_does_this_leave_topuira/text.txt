    This puts 145 in such a bad spot honestly. They canâ€™t even do an interim because everybody is fresh off of losses, and the only guy that makes sense in Holloway is already down 3-0 to Volk

    I mean they might have to do that and if Max wins then you canâ€™t really deny him a 4th shot at the title then

    Some guesses
  


    Volk loses, or wins and keeps 145: Volk-Ilia in March?
  


    Volk wins, vacates 145: Max-Ilia 2024 Q1
  


    Volk wins, isnâ€™t sure: Interim title fight between Ilia-Allen/Evloev winner
