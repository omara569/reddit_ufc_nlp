Just look at what happened to belal, dricus, and gamrot(backup fighter but still). Dude just lies out of his ass and people are forced to eat it up. He’s literally lying about USADA now too because they made the UFC look unprofessional and bad.Dana’s word don’t mean shit

    Usman getting the 185 belt would be insane

    Yeah 1 win over someone that's barely competed in mw after 2 convincing losses is crazy I guess he saved the card and is being rewarded Dana probably assumes khamzat takes it

    Can Islam get a WW shot as back up?

    Belal is still next in line at WW, and back ups are there for people who drop out on the day of the fight; not while there's still time to find a replacement. Only person getting screwed is Dricus

    Basically for the belt they both kill Sean

    Ik that but it all comes down to the fact- he lost his last 2 in row with no controversy, so to get the title shot off  a win (which I doubt he will so all of talk could be for nothing) is debatable, that's all. It's fine if you don't agree with me.
  
    And for sure they all got the privilege as well, not just Usman
