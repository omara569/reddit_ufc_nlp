All four fight to the death. Who wins?

Charles pulls guard, leaving him completely defenseless to brutal leg kicks from the other three. Four and a half minutes later, nothing remains of Charles Olivera except his iconic yellow shorts.

Khabib takes Volk’s back but he somehow stands up with his crazy dwarf strength. Volk and Holloway start going at it in the center of the octagon with Khabib on Volk’s back. This significantly hinders Alex’s speed and movement, but he valiantly ducks and weaves as Max throws the same combo over and over. Eventually he shoots a takedown, but alas - Khabib is on top, and chokes Volk to death as Max watches from below, traumatized.

Khabib and Holloway stand up and circle around each other slowly. The camera peels back to reveal an erupting volcano in the distance. With a knowing glance, Khabib realizes that even the victor is not leaving this fight alive. He quickly attempts an iminari roll and kills Holloway using a Boston crab submission, the only move he has worked on since entering retirement.

Satisfied, Khabib sits down and watches the sun rise as the lava from the volcano gushes down the mountain. The Eagle has won - but at what cost? Olivera, actually alive, walks over and sits down next to Khabib. They embrace as we cut to black.
