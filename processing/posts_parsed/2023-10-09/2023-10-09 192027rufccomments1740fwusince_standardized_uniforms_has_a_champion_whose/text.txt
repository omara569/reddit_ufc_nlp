Since standardized uniforms, has a champion whose ever come out not in black and gold (befitting a champion) won a title fight?
and what’s your opinion on non black and gold champ shorts?

    Izzy beat Cannonier in Green and Gold, but the odds due favour Champs wearing Black and Gold in the several other instances it’s happened. The night I saw Moreno come out in white for the 3rd Figgy fight, I just had this gut feeling it was going to cost him.

    I'm not sure about who has won without the standard shorts but those white and gold shorts look clean as fuck.

    Nunes technically had yellow and gold trunks when she beat the breaks off Peña in the rematch because she was somehow still the 145 Champ.
