Jon was allowed to get away many times without facing serious consequences for his actions, other fighters careers got ruined for not even doing 10% of what he has done, how can he be the GOAT with such heavy favoritism?

    If U don't want Jones to b in the GOAT convo then we should stop having GOAT convos. It is a pointless thing to discuss and Idk why we keep having them

    Could make an argument that having someone with such a bad reputation be the face of your organization would drive away new viewership as well as discredit your organization‚Äôs professionalism (in other words, less money) but I guess the ufc didn‚Äôt exactly have a good rep to begin with soü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

    Like is there any other organisation where you'd be allowed to compete after popping for steroids 5 times and doing everything else he's done? i dont want all figthers to be good people but come on, diaz or lyoto's career got wasted for doing stuff not even 10% as bad as him.

    Most fighters are on roids that's why the punishment isn't/wasnt severe. All the BS outside the ring you can complain about though.

    What are serious consequences to you? And what has he done?
