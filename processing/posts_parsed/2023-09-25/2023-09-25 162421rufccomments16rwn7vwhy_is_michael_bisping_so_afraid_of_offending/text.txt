Why is Michael Bisping so afraid of offending others, despite being a trashtalker in his fighter days? He always frontloads his opinions with a million disclaimers, and spams phrases like "now, I'm not judging anyone but..." all the time

    He used to get paid to fight. Now he gets paid to talk. Different job, different rules

    Exactly. As well as I have heard him say with age he has a different perspective on certain things and doesn't want a verbal spat with active fighters because it's not his place anymore

    He's got a good thing going with the UFC it would be stupid and a waste of all the work he's done just to get cancelled over some dumb shit he said on his podcast or something

    He has to be impartial. It's part of his job. He's entitled to his opinions, but that comes with some caveats.

    The UFC did a hell of a job repackaging him. He’s a company guy now, what do you expect. But still is this about the whole Bryce and not letting him carry on the interview, I have to imagine that wasn’t Bispings call, but it is odd, when people say thank you Jesus or some people pray. I guess it is odd that since his “religion” is seen as fake or cringe they didn’t let him have that moment. Always double standards lol

    When was the last time a fighter got to do any prayer on the mic regardless of religion?

    Because people grow and change. He's retired, no longer fighting, and is a commentator, so he needs to be as unbiased and impartial as possible

    Fucks sakes, you expect him to be in his drunken fight days? You want him to spit on Mitchell's face, and tell him to stfu?
  
    Cos, I'm all for it!!!
