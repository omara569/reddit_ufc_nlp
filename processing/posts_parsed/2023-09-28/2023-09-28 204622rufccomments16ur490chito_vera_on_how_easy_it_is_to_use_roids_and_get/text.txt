    Then you wonder why so many fighters train in mountains, thailand, deserts and bunch of made up shit just to avoid already pathetic testing company lmao
  
    Their biggest star popped several times, their second biggest star shows up with gyno tits for his toughest matches and then there is Connor who literally said he is on juice lmao

    By banning IVs, USADA told the world how to beat them. Plus, the only way to catch someone using an IV is by catching them in the act.

    I mean look at the fucking roster dude. Has anybody ever looked at Kamaru Usman and thought: wow he looks natural. Same goes for every other fighter in the UFC.

    It’s obvious…look at some of the fighters, they are shredded like bodybuilders but also fight ferociously. Example jailton almeida, kamaru usman, mohammed usman.

    Yep. People forget about that too, he served a 2 year suspension for missing like 5 straight USADA tests, he swears he was in a remote Aztec training ground with no service. Then, like you said, suddenly he can go 5 rounds when he used to struggle with 3.
