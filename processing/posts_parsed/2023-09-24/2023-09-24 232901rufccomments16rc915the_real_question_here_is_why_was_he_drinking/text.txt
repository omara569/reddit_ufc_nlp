The real question here is why was he drinking three weeks out from his fight? Is this normal?

    Drinking 3 weeks from a fight is no big deal bro, his reading was at 87mg which is like tipsy to medium drunk, enough that you shouldn’t drive but no big deal if we’re talking about his performance

    Ok thanks thought as he was quite a bit over the limit he must have been drunk.

    Drinking before a fight is absolutely not “no big deal”… If you are drinking 3 weeks before a fight it shows lack of dedication and discipline. That’s why mostly all fighters completely cut out alcohol during their camp entirely. You have the IQ level equivalent to a rock

    they need to make a better distinction for champions. 5x Defending or 8x UFC champion fighter. 2x sounds better then 1x when in reality you lost the belt for a period of time

    Really they should just say former ufc champion. No need to be specific.

    I think they should just call it Xx defending champion. Like, Khabib is a 3x defending UFC champion. I agree, it's a common misconception but it does sound better when you lose and win the belt back multiple times.

    I always thought they should call it an X time world champion, where X is the number of title fights you’ve won. So DJ for example would be a 12 time UFC World champion. Rather than saying he only won the belt once
