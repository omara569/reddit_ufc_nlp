C.E.O. of ONE Championship Chatri Sityodtong explains why ONE is full of world champions before they arrive and theyâ€™re already multiple time world champions at their peak of their career when they arrive at ONE in comparison to UFC that has a mediocre-low level striking and Jiu-Jitsu practitioners.

One is not only an MMA promotion, they have kickboxing, muay thai and bjj divisions, in which the best pound-for-pound fighters of the world perform, it's a fact, Allazov is the number 1 pound-for-pound kickboxer, and he is their champ, they also have most of the official top 10 kickboxers of the world, Glory is very very inferior to them now, and their Rodtang is their champ in muay thai and he is number 1 in muay thai in the world, and absolutely all muay thai fighters in the world perform for them, this is also a fact, but their MMA divisions are inferior to the ufc by a million times, but what he says is that the best strikers and bjj practitioners perform for them and that they are better at it than the ufc is 100% true

Compared to One, UFC probably has similar level of bjj guys fighting for them (Burns, Rodolfo, etc), but has better bjj guys competing for them  on their UFC Fight Pass Invitational cards (Gordon Ryan, Craig Jones, Felipe Pena, Nicky Rodriguez, etc.).

I'm a casual fan who watches only UFC events. Mostly every PPV and some fight nights. Is ONE really that good as the CEO claims?

I'll put it this way.

UFC is the standard for premier mma league. If you want to be considered the best in the world, you go to thr ufc and become champion.

In terms of the quality of product though, I think ONE on average puts on way more fun fights even if you don't know who the fighters are. The bigger divisions, not so much though.

And the diversity of combat sports they put on, benefits the product quality too.

You're not gonna see wild shit like DJ vs Rodtang in a special rules match in the ufc ever.

ONE is an event with Kickboxing, Grappling, Muay Thai and MMA, not exclusively MMA. In terms of the quality that is about right but if you compare only MMA, then it isn't the whole truth of the paragraph above.  Hope this helps out.

Kickboxing, Muay Thai and Grappling yes. For individual sports, they got the best in the region. Their MMA is still not as good as UFC especially in higher weight classes.

Is any company as good as its CEO claims?

I like ONE but I feel too many champions and too many martial at once overloads fhe casual fan and distracts to the marketing n appreciation of each champion. Similar to having too many menu items in restaurant.

I feel that ONE needs to use MMA as a marketing tool and get casual fans addicted to their super entertaining Muay Thai
