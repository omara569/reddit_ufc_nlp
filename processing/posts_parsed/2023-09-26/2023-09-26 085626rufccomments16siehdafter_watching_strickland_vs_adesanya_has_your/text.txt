    Izzy needs a time out imo
  
    He looked tired
  
    Give him 9 months then we can judge him.

    After watching Burns vs Chimaev, has your opinion on a potential fight between Adesanya and Chimaev changed?

    No. Izzy has nothing to deter Khamzat from wrestling him. Burns has elite BJJ and was throwing submissions from the bottom.
  
    Khamzat only brawled because he wasn’t comfortable defending submissions.
  
    Izzy also gets his back taken a lot when scrambling up. But most MW wrestlers don’t punish him for it.

    Not really. Burns has one of the best bjj in the UFC history.

    No because izzys style works perfect for people who try to rush him because he's a counter fighter. For example,  Kelvin, rob, paulo, yoel a little, brunson to name a few. Khamzhat will definitely rush and u know he got caught by gilbet who also has great striking.

    He got “caught by Gilbert” after already taking Gilbert down and letting him up back to the feet because he liked his chances more there. It was a choice to keep it on the feet for Khamzat. Israel might be able to catch Khamzat comin in and sleep him, but if Khamzat gets a body lock at any point in the fight, it’s hitting the mat.
