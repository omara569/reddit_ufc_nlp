    I was at Walgreens yesterday, I live in Fairfax VA, and they didn’t have any newports and I asked th cashier what’s up? And he told me many people have been going inside, behind the counter and stealing like cartons of cigarettes, like you see those videos of dudes just coming in groups and robbing places, kinda sad it came to my town now.

    Home Depot is good for buying your mom a plant for Mother’s Day. Any actual tradesman is going to go to a supply house for an at home project.
