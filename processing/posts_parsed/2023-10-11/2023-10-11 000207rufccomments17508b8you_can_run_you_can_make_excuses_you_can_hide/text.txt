You can run, you can make excuses, you can hide behind his win streak, but Charles quitting again vs Islam is inevitable.

    People love Charles because they have watched him grow up through the UFC and turn into a must-watch fighter. I don't care that he has multiple defeats, I don't care that he got beaten comfortably by Islam last time out. I just want to see another Oliviera fight.

    People harping on this “he’s a quitter” stuff. If he was a quitter he wouldn’t gotten up and then finished everyone in the top 5 besides Islam

    it is really telling when everyone who said he was a quitter for the last 2 years would have been lambasted and called a clown, ratio'd, etc
  
    But now DJ said it, people don't know how to respond, like "well I guess if the GOAT said it... haha"
  
    People really don't have their own opinions without following whoever they think has the highest credentials

    well DJ does have a fuck-ton of credentials and he’s not calling him a quitter, he’s saying he just buckles under pressure. sounds like the same thing but one is an insult and the other is a critique.
