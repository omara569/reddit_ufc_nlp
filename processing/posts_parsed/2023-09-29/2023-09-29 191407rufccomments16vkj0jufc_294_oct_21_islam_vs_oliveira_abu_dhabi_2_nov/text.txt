UFC 294 Oct. 21 / Islam vs Oliveira, Abu Dhabi (2) | Nov. 4 / Blaydes vs. Almeida - San Paulo, Brazil (?!?!) Why does Oliveira have to fight in Abu Dhabi again when UFC will be in his HOMETOWN two weeks later?

Cause it's a fight night and not a PPV

Because UFC is contracted to bring a certain amount of title fights to that host country because they are paying the UFC for that amount.

Brazil shouldnâ€™t get another PPV after the 283 shitshow

If it was in Brazil, the fans would throw food at Islam after he subs Charles.
