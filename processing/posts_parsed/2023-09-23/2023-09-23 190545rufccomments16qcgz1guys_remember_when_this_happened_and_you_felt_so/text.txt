    I pray that tony comes back and finishes paddy then rides off into the sunset. Would be the best thing I’ve seen in a long time.

    Regardless of the outcome, he needs to lay them gloves down after the fight

    I wasn't sad tbh. Tony is completely past his prime. He'll keep getting finished until he suffers a severe mental episode and is forced to quit.

    Flipping his truck was kinda a “severe mental episode” in my book 😂💀 he is definitely past his prime but I want to see him absolutely butt fuck patty then retire on that note.

    You should watch beige frequency on YouTube did a great video on tony and his mental episodes he’s had and recent one from earlier this year. As a tony fan I’m very worried about him and his family hope he retires

    I was genuinely concerned Tony was dead when he was out cold for so long. Saw this shit live. I still think back to Chandler doing those silly backflips when Tony was just plastered on the canvas and I always start laughing.

    Tony, face down, while chandler paces back and forth, holding up his finger going: “one more?”

    I was there in person and I’ll never forget the feeling of my stomach dropping thinking Tony wasn’t gonna get up. Felt like he was laying there for an eternity

    I feel like this is the fight Tony actually wanted for the past couple years. He lost his last 6 fights to line this fight up. I actually like his chances in this fight. Tony anaconda choke 1st round.
