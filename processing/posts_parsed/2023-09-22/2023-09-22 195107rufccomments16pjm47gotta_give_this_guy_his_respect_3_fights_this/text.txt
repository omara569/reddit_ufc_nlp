    Must be killer on the body in later years though with how quick kb fighters fight, izzy has about 113 pro fights between boxing kb and mma and alex has about 45 kb iirc and a bunch of wars there

    Izzy is the best striker while alex is almost the best but he is also the most dangerous striker

    Itâ€™s crazy he could have started the year a champion, lost the belt, & win another championship all in one year
