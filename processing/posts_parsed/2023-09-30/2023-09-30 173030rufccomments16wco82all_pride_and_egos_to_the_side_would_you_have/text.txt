    I am very confident in my abilities, a healthy ego, and can honestly say Ngannou would probably kill me with one punch.

    Erm I think I have like 15-20 seconds of running and then 2 seconds of wriggling my head around on the ground away from bombs and then Iâ€™d sleep

    I run faster than Nganno, Rozenstruik and Chelsea Chandler, so Yes.

    Only if it's taking place in an open field. I can outrun him. If it's in a cage, hell no

    not even half as long. Assume 1 punch per second, the first two are destroying any guard I have, and he can just run at me cause nothing I can do can damage him.
