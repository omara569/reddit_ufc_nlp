Unironically stopped hanging out with Darren Till and his English improved

He has crazy eyes. No wonder he thinks he deserves the belt in a different weight after not fighting for a year

Why would he do negative promotion

Preview photo of this looks like a hostel-esque horror movie

Khamzat as the deranged psycho who tries to get people to sympathize with him but is too hard due to how crazy he is lol.

“They are hiding that belt for me” as he comes into his first Middleweight fight shortly.

I mean, my man, it is traditional to fight at least a couple of times before you get a title shot…

"I don't know why I'm not getting a title shot"

It's like he didn't flip off everyone in the crowd and tell everyone how much he doesn't care that he fucked his chance at showing he can handle a main event by not making weight.

It happens, there's a few ways to deal with the situation, he chose the "Burn all of my bridges" option, and then wonders why he can't cross the bridge.

Sean’s fought 4 times since this bum stepped in the cage. Get active dummy
