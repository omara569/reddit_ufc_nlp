Y’all hated him when he was at the top and now y’all love him when he is down. Fickle ass fans. Y’all shoulda gave him cred in his prime

    YEs, his activity was insane as a champ. Guy might be an ass for the cheap fouls like fence grab but he still defended his title a lot in  such a short time

    Didn't like him then don't like him now. Op soft AF for thinking everyone is the same as him. That fickle casual ass piece

    bro nobody changed their opinion you just don’t hear the haters anymore because he fell from the top. they got what they wanted so of course now you’re going to hear the people hyping him back up.

    Active champs are pretty rare, so he’s a stud in that sense. But outside of that, you have a pretty boring fighter with a pretty boring personality who by all reasonable assumption is a drug cheat.
  
    He gives off good human vibes and made Lolby cry. And blasted masvidal hilariously. Easy guy to be conflicted about.

    I mean he’s not really a boring fighter tho look at his title run against the best of the best. Also a boring personality is perfectly fine look at volk. As long as they show up and fight

    Not sure how accurate it is, but I remember debating on Reddit if he was pound for pound best. He got plenty of love, it was the head kick that started the memes and shit.
