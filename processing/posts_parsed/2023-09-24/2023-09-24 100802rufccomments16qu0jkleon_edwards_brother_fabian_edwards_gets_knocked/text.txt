    It’s all good until you start spitting on a KO’ed opponent after the bell

    You can literally see dude flip Fabian off and curse him out while standing over his unconscious body.
  
    Sign him Dana, #4 pound-for-pound, 31 years old, and undefeated, seems like he can make shit interesting

    That’s not even the worst of it. Dude spit at him aswell right before he walked off…

    So did Edwards say something before/during the fight or is Eblan just a POS?

    Nope fairly normal trash talk as far as I can tell...

    Eblen spits on Fabian after the KO in the clip. I assume Leon came in to rearrange his face.

    Spitting on your knocked out opponent should be an immediate DQ

    Uh, that should be an automatic ban from the organization. Can't believe it isn't

    Can you become anymore unlikeable as a fighter. A huge win and then you embarrass yourself like this

    What a cunt, hopefully Leon roundhouse kicks his jaw so he can't spit anymore
