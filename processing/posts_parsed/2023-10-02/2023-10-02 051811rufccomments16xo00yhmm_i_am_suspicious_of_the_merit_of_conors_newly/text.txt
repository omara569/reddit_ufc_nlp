Hmm I am suspicious of the merit of Conor’s newly acquired black belt

I love Sean Strickland’s response to belts. He just goes “I got a black belt in BJJ. It’s somewhere in my trunk or something…doesn’t work”.

He said he threw it in the trash 🤣, and I'm starting to think with good reason. Nearly any time I see videos of blackbelts in any discipline, I'm underwhelmed. It looks more and more like just a prize, and not really anything else. If a person can fight, they can fight. A belt isn't needed.

You should suspicious of most MMA fighters who achieve a black belt lol

Uncle Chael tells the story of a guy (Coleman maybe?) who didn’t have any bjj belt. So he went to the store and bought a black belt, and told the bjj black belts in the gym that if they didn’t like it, they could take it from him. Of course, they couldn’t. I think Khabib had a blue belt.

Belt rankings are cool, but not ironclad. I’d bet the black belt at my local gym would get tapped by a purple belt from Danaher’s team.

Have you rolled with him in a BJJ match setting? No? Do you even train BJJ? Then how do you know better than his head coach if he deserves one or not?

We ve seen him grapple before Lol. His bjj isnt bad but no way is he a black belt. He looked helpless vs Dustin on the ground.

Conor has three gold belts, who cares about a black belt?

BJJ belts are overrated anyway. I know it’s about knowledge and all but when you see white belts with actual fight experience triangle the shit out of brown and black belts then yeah… have fun with your belt while you’re trying to wake up again.
