    Lol thanks for posting this. The hypocrisy from MMA fans always makes me laugh.
  
    I wonder what the new excuse will be after Islam wins again

    Islam vs Volk: “Islam lost to a featherweight.”
  
    Volk vs Charles: “Bro imagine if Do Bronx went on to beat the number 1 P4P fighter in the world in his own backyard with a shortened rehydration period?”

    idk why, when the fight first got announced, i really wanted Benny to lose (i thought he was boring). but once he actually did, it kinda hurt tbh. i loved that Charles won, but man, imagine being on a 8 fight winstreak, one fight away from a title shot, and then losing, especially in that fashion, fuck man.

    Beniel looked horrible in comparison to his last few fights, but with that being said even at his best id still favor charles to win.
