Strawweight: Tatiana Suarez        Women's flyweight: Valentina Shevchenko (I think she could beat Grasso in the trilogy and maybe even possible quadrilogy)        Men's flyweight: Brandon Royval (I think he could beat Pantoja, I mean it's the year of upsets so who knows)        Women's bantamweight: Raquel Pennington (I know she's gonna fight Pena for the vacant belt and I just want Pena to lose)        Men's bantamweight: Umar Nurmagomedov        Featherweight: Max Holloway (if he beats Topuria I could see Volk vacating the belt either to retire or move up to lightweight permanently. Max will fight for the vacant belt and win.)        Lightweight: Islam Makachev        Welterweight: Leon Edwards        Middleweight: Khamzat Chimaev        Light heavyweight: Alex Pereria        Heavyweight: Ciryl Gane (Jon Jones is most likely gonna retire at 295 and honestly I could see him beating Serghei or Tom Aspinal if he fought onw for the belt)Who I think will be champion of each weight class when 2024 ends (names/weight classes of each fighter and reasons why for a few of them)

    Volk won't vacate, he wants double champ he's just losing bargaining power if he's no longer featherweight belt holder.

    If he loses to Makachev (which I personally think he will) his chances of becoming a double champ will be over pretty much. He's pretty old at this point

    He's definitely a future champ but I don't think it'll be by the end of 2024
