Which one is a bigger upset? Conor McGregor beating Mayweather or Francis beating Tyson Fury

Conor beating Floyd, even a 40 year old version of him, would've been insane. It would've had massive ramifications for combat sport culture I think.

Frank beating Fury would be huge too, but its HW boxing. One good punch could change everything.

Lol there’s literally dudes in the heavyweights who are technically awful but got by because they can punch a hole through a brick wall. Conor knocking out Floyd would’ve hurt boxing MASSIVELY.

Why doesn’t Francis have a boner like Conor did after the press photo?

He does, it’s just taped to his ankle.

This clearly Shows Hes Not motivated enough. Francis has no Chance without any sexual tension

If McGregor had beaten Mayweather I’d go as far as to say it would have been the biggest upset in sports history. An amateur boxer, on debut, defeating the greatest boxer of all time.

Francis striking is so wild and telegraphed I genuinely think Fury could beat him without even being touched. So I feel like if somehow he can pull off a win then it will be the biggest upset of all time.

Imagine how insane would Connor become if he would beat Floyd?
