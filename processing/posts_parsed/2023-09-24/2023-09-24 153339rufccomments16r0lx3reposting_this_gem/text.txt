    I put that first Tony meme in there because it was absurd and funny. Cut to a few months later, it's not that absurd anymore

    I upvoted precisely at the one about Mario. Idk much about the dude, but Iâ€™ve personally seen some questionable shit
  
    Edit; The one about the UFC contract hit home. I have a buddy (who will remain nameless) that got accepted into the UFC, after a very colorful career in multiple other franchises.
  
    Bro posted a selfie after that meeting looking almost defeated. Iâ€™d never seen him looking that negative before.
