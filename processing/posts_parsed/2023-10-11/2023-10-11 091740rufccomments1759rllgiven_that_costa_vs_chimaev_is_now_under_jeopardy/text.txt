Given that Costa vs Chimaev is now under jeopardy. Who would you like to see step up against Khamzat?

    Adesanya if he is crazy motherfucker.
  

    Realisticaly Cannonier or DDP.
  

    Vettori dont have balls and Whitaker is too heavy on short notice.

    DDP beat Whittaker 3 months ago, why would he take short notice against an unranked MW?

    Adesanya gotta get it together first because that showing in Sydney wasn’t entertaining or competitive.
  
    DDP out, Cannonier is possible but considering he’s in line for a title shot why risk it?
  
    Khamzat most likely gonna destroy some top 20 unknown and sit up till after Ramadan smh.

    Well since Marvin sadly declined, I reckon the backup should be Jared Cannonier.
  
    I hope they just cancel his fight with Dolidize this December for that upcoming Fight Night, and have Dolidze just fight the winner of Craig vs Allen.
  
    Jared already stated he has Interest In fighting Khamzat Chimaev In his pre-fight press conference before he fought Vettori, and that he'd accept It on one condition that It's a contenders match that gets him a title shot, probably against the winner of Dricus vs Strickland.
  
    So I think that's the only option the UFC has now, because I don't see what else they could do since Marvin turned down the offer to be the backup, and every other ranked MW Is pre-occupied or already have fights booked.
