Let this dude do USADA's job since they're out soon and then we'll see who starts failing drug tests.

    It’d be hilarious if Derek became head of testing but it’d never happen cuz he has a huge supplement business and a trt clinic business to run already

    I feel like their could be synergy with his trt clinic and ped testing

    Also Derek doesn't ethically agree with drug testing because it's only capable of detecting the stuff we know about and have some data on.
  
    That in turn forces people to use weird obscure and novel steroids that could be very bad for your health instead of the ones we have 60 years of data on

    I think you are mistakenly coming from the premise that the UFC wants to catch everyone who is doing banned substances. They merely brought USADA in to clean up the image and reputation of the sport when it came to PEDs. They sweep stuff under the rug anytime they can and ultimately have parted with USADA because they wouldn't play ball due to too many curious cats regarding Conor McGregor's situation.

    No no no fuck that! Let them juice! If you hire somebody, hire somebody less consistent, because Derek would literally catch them all.
