    Holy shit Belal about to get the Beniel treatment, hopefully he can keep his win streak going if he loses he's prob never getting a title shot üò≠
  
    Edit: Belal doesn't even know who it is lmao, just tweeted this

    Dana really out here saying ‚ÄúYeah Belal, since you did the solid of giving us the Burns fight, after Colby, that Title Shot is YOURS kid‚Ä¶ . . .
  
    Just gotta beat Kamaru first AND to really show us your dedication, we put in a No Rehydration Clause at 170 BUT only for you.‚Äù

    If you're Belal why do you take that fight after Dana already promised you a title shot after Colby? Makes perfect sense for Usman, if he wins he's back in the title picture.

    Must be. With all the other guys booked, no way he‚Äôd go down to fight Geoff Neal. Usman would be the only guy he‚Äôd fight aside from a title. That‚Äôs a good match up

    Man I don't like Belal and I don't want to watch him fight for a title, but I seriously want to hear Dana's excuse for not giving Belal a title shot. He has more top 10 wins than some defending champions. Even for Belal treatment standards, I was certain he earned a title shot by knocking out Sean Brady, an undefeated prospect. Then he dominated Gilbert Burns. Sure he was crippled, not Belal's fault. If he finished Burns, the fans and the UFC would probably hate him even more. Now they're gonna feed him to Usman lol
