What is this main card..
I love that fight nights are free, but damn they really skimp on em sometimes. I like Bobby green, but he’s not a main event kind of fighter. Especially now that his chin is gone

    These are sick fights if you’re not just a top 5 fan… you do know there’s more fighters on the roster than just like Izzy, Connor, Poirer, and Jones right??

    Joe Pyfer’s got a lot of hype and is Dana’s bff, Morono Vs Buckley is a wicked match up with two nearly Top 15 level opponents, Drew Dober is almost incapable of putting in a boring fight, Hernandez Vs Algeo will be a total war, and Ion Cutelaba is the human amalgamation of a flipped coin when it comes to fighting.
  
    Yeah it’s an apex card so it’s weaker then most other cards by default, but this is far from the weakest series of sparring sessions Hunter and Dana have sold as an “Event”.

    These are great fights honestly. Pfyer v Abdul is a banger, someone is going down. Morono v Buckley also a banger, Drew Dober is always fun to watch & brings it every single time. This is an underrated card I can’t lie. Main event might be iffy since Dawson might just wrestle fuck Bobby the entire match, that’s the only boring fight I see really if that does happen.
