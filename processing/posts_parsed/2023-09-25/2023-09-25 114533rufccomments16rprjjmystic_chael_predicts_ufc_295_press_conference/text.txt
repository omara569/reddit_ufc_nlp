    he’s been corrected live on air by ariel helwani how to pronounce it.
  
    i assume he purposely mispronounces fighters names ti increase the amount of comments his videos get, which boosts views because more people are engaging

    Gotta love Chael xD. You have to admit though, this group probably has the worst cumulative press conference ability compared to their cumulative level of stardom.

    Listening to Chael is more valuable than a college education. His 10 mins video is worth 14 credit hours at any university in America

    My exact thoughts looking at this card. Great fights, but I’d rather saw my ears off then watch the press conference. The fighters themselves not having too much interesting shit to say will be fine (aside from maybe Benois and Frevola), but the absolutely uninteresting questions that modern reporters give them makes it so much worse. Say what you will about Ariel, he made pressers interesting.

    Chael is somehow both underrated and overrated
