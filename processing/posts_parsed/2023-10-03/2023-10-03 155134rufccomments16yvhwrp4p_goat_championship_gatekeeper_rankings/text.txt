P4P GOAT championship gatekeeper rankings?
These guys would be champs had there not been better champs at the time. They look great against contenders, destroy prospects, but are fed contenders too soon and halt all their title chasing dreams.

    Getting repeated title shots and failing and being a gatekeeper are two entirely different things.
  
    Gatekeepers are the guys up and comers fight to prove they can hang with a best / beat to earn a title shot. Not sure how this fits with guys like dustin who haven't fought new blood in forever.

    Not sure what to call these guys then.
  
    Max is the GOAT of this category, but guys who are inconsistently champ material? Like in a perfect world without freaks, they'd be champs.
  
    I was being generous putting Dariush in there, but it's kinda the same like he slaughters prospects and weeds out contenders, but he gets highlight reeled by most top fighters.

    Max is not a gate keeper

    Max and Poirier. Sad to see Max moved to gatekeeper, but as long as Volk is at 145 that’s what he’s gonna be.

    If Gaethje doesn't win his next title fight, he gets added here. Hope he knocks it out
