I don't really know any mma fans outside of those I train with but when I see the ppv/event crowds most of em don't look like they train.Do the majority of MMA fans also train? Or are the majority just sport fans?

Just bleed. Nothing better then watching people hurt themselves for my amusement.

No way. This sport has the most uninformed fanbase of any sport that's ever existed.

That makes sense though, you don't need to know how to fight to appreciate two people beating the shit out of each other. It's why we gathered around fights in school.

I train but I was a ufc fan before I ever trained. The reason I started training was because of the UFC. Most of my friends that are ufc fans do not train

Boxed and did Muay Thai when I was younger. But life, having a family, work etc (and age) put an end to that 9 years ago haha.

But MMA is like any sport. 90% of people just enjoy watching. Nothing wrong with that.

It does kinda piss me off with combat sport fans that don't show respect to the fighters though. Win or lose. Ammy or Pro. They all deserve respect.

I do as much kickboxing/Muay Thai as a can, brain injuries killed my dreams of actually competing

Iâ€™d say itâ€™s like 70/30. 70% are just fans. 10% actually train. 20% say they train but in reality they hit a bag in their garage they bought off of Craigslist. ðŸ˜‚

I wouldn't say the majority, but this subreddit in particular has a lot of MMA amateurs and practitioners. Which would make sense as you're obviously going to look for a circle of like-minded individuals.

Though, if you go to live events and sports bar, you'd soon realize the average MMA fan fits every stereotype you can think of. And that doesn't include training.
