That's some crazy ass odds for Shavkat. Colby Leon is actually much closer than I thought.

    I think the odds are correct for the card. Leon vs Colby is honestly a 50/50 remember that Colby is a very good fighter he has a great ground game and also can trade of the feet if he needs to. I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if he wrestle fucks Leon. As well with Shavkat the dude is killer I would take him to win by tko for better odds
