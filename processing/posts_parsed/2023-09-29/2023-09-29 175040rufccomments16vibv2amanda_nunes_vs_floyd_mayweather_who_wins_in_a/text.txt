Amanda Nunes Vs. Floyd Mayweather. Who wins in a hypothetical street fight?
Currently having this debate with some friends, curious to hear your thoughts.        I personally have Floyd winning, due to physical advantages as well as his superior stand up game. My friends are firm on the stance that Nunes wins, as she has training in various techniques rather than just boxing, and could take the fight to the ground and win. I stated guys like Stipe have had successful careers despite having limited variety in fighting style, though they dismissed this idea. What do you guys think?        Also preferably, answer as if we were simulating the fight 10 times. Which fighter would come out victorious the most out of 10 bouts?
