    I only watched main card of Gamrot vs Fiziev. It was OK. Fiziev getting injured was disappointing but ðŸ’© happens.
  
    Also you can let go and refrain from watching so much for a couple of weeks and maybe give some more attention to other areas of your life and then once Countdown hits, you go deep again. That whole 294 week is going to be crazy.
