Whatâ€™s the difference between Stipe coming off 3 years of inactivity, and Jon Jones coming off 3 years of inactivity?

    Jon was 35 when he came back, Stipe will be 41

    Stipe is over 40. Has been in HW wars. And his last fight he got sparked by Big Frank.

    Yeah, the difference is Stipe was banished to the Shadow Realm and Jones hasn't gone there ever.

    Stipe is way older and way more damaged.

    Stipe is coming back at 41 years after a catastrophique loss by KO, his last 5 fights have been wars in which he got knocked out twice. On the other side Jones had a 3 years layoff due to mental (and physical) weariness of competition. Huge difference here but I'm 100% rooting with Stipe.

    Stiopic also has sustained permanent vision damage from fighting DC.

    Or was it a 3-year USADA suspension?

    Stipe was fighting fires and Jon was fighting cases.
