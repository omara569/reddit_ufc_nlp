    The way he punched Frank Mir, Frank looks like the weed just kicked in and he forgot how to function.

    Such a underappreciated legend. Man went into a 10 fight win streak at heavyweight, beating guys like Werdum, Mir, Carwin and Velasquez. Yeah, he didn't had the best career after the beatings Cain put on him, but he still has one of the best resumes at HW

    My favorite heavyweight personality. He was always smiling and kind and represented the ufc well as champ. When he did TUF it was awesome to watch how much he cared.
