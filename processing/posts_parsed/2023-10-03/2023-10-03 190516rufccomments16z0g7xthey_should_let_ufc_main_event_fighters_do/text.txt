They should let UFC main event fighters do walkouts like this. This is better than almost any UFC walkout.

    My favorite walk outs:
  
    McGregor at 189, probably the best ever.
  
    Till that one time to sweet Caroline.
  
    Khamzat when he sprinted from the tunnel to the cage.
  
    Honorable mention: Mike Perry coming out to Halo

    As much as I hate paddy pimblett, his walkouts have been electric. The music is perfect and the “ohhhh paddy the baddy” chants are golden.
  
    Bisping’s “song 2” walkouts with the entire crowd chanting “WOO HOO” are great.
  
    TKZ’s retirement walkout. One of the best of all time.
  
    I hate Colby, but his kurt angle entrance was legendary.
  
    Tai Tuivasa has had some hilarious walkouts with song choices that really fit him.
  
    Joaquin Buckley walking out to “ni**as in Paris” in Paris was hilarious.

    I dont get it, all I see is a dude walking to the ring while some other dudes are following him pretending to sing a song (thats clearly pre recorded). 3/10 honestly.

    PRIDE walkouts were dialed in.

    Canelo is the man, but this slow walk giant posse thing that boxers do is corny IMO. I think the UFC walkouts are better than this mostly.

    I strongly disagree shits super corny. It already takes them a ridiculous amount of time to get through to the fights
