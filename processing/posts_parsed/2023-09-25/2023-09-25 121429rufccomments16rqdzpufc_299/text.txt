    This is fake. My guess is they are saying 299 is gonna be a trash card considering 300 is the next one and they will likely try to jam pack that card with bangers.

    This is a fight night brother. Also, Sam Patterson does not deserve a fight with CDF, done nothing in the UFC besides get killed by Ashmouz

    There's a good chance they'll make this card if Dana suddenly decides he hates selling PPV's.
