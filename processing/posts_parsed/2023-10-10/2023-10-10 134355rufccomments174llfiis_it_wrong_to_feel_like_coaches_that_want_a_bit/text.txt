I see these guys and they're always meatriding their roster and it's like they want a bit of limelight- just let your fighter do interviews solo.        Say what you will about Izzy and Conor but their coaches aren't all in their interviews just nuthugging them nearly as much as some coaches.        Coaches like Khabib, Henry, and Wittman can be behind the scenes where they belong and still get credibility and do one on one interviews (mostly).Is it wrong to feel like coaches that want a bit of fame off their fighters are bad for their fighters?

    Never trust a guy who wears glasses like that in combo with a golden chain.

    Tim Welch is the perfect blend, stays behind the scenes enough during Sean’s fights but in the meantime they help each other grow their own social media

    I was literally thinking the same thing. Welch is good at what he does, he seems to work very well with Sean, and he doesn’t demand the spotlight. They have a podcast together because they seem like genuine friends that would hangout regardless of fighter/coach relationship, and Tim knows that Sean is the clear draw between the two, and people who care more about the sport will be interested in him (Welch) too.
  
    Everything he does in the name of being Sean’s coach is seemingly to further Sean’s career, and because he’s attached to Sean, he gets to ride to the top with him.

    Coaches are also a significant factor of their fighter's success. Why shouldn't they get some recognition?

    Yeah, I'm confused by this post, lol. In boxing, the trainer has always been famous. In some cases, he is just as famous as the fighter. Why would MMA be any different?

    Ciryls coach gives me bad vibes. He deff wants the spotlight and has even said it.
  
    While Captain Eric comes off as a tool I think he actually cares a lot for his fighters and always goes to bat for them
