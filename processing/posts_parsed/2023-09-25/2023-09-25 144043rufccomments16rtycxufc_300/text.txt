    Even as a huge fan of Conor's, I do not believe he deserves to snag a big spot like this. Whenever he decides to come back I know he'll get a main event, but leave this one to the active superstars.

    this is the second person I've seen put connor as the main event followed by title fights, no matter how big connor is, they will never put a title fight as a co-main to a non title fight, it ruins the legitimacy of the belt
