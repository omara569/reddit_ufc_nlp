    You and Stipe are pretty much the only ones who believe that.
  
    He’s 41. He looked visibly slower his last fight before getting brutally KO’d. He’s been inactive for over 2 years and is now a full time firefighter.
  
    There is nothing about current Stipe that should make you think he’s going to win this fight. If it happened in 2016 it would have been a legendary banger. But 2023…nah.

    I’m with you. The way no one is giving Stipe a chance seems crazy to me.

    This sub in January: "Jones has been inactive for three years, father time, untested at HW, looked bad in his last few fights, slowed down, he's in for a challenge with Gane and Gane is going to walk through him".
  
    This sub in September: "I never doubted Jones. Stipe has been inactive for three years, father time, untested at HW after his knockout, looked bad in his last few fights, slowed down, Jones is going to walk through him"

    I think that the people calling Stipe "washed", are at best, ignorant drama queens.
  
    Two arguments being parroted by these people:
  
"Stipe looked old and slow when he got knocked out by Francis".

    Really?  What about the other 9 guys that Francis KO'd in the UFC before Stipe?  Were they all old and slow too?  This stupidity is just that, stupidity to bolster a stupid argument.
  
"Stipe has been inactive for too long, blah blah fucking blah, and more stupid shit".

    3 years and one month.  That is how long Jon jones was inactive between Reyes and Gane.
  
    3 years and one month.  That is how long Stipe has currently been inactive since losing his belt to Francis.
  
    By the time they fight in November, Stipe will have been inactive for 2 months longer than jones.
  
    The entirety of flapping ones lips about Stipe being inactive, is a fucking stupid argument to begin with.  It completely ignores the fact that Stipe very much wanted a rematch with Francis.... not at all Stipes fault that the ufc played games with "interim belts".
  
    There is also zero doubt that Stipe should have been one of the two fighters matched up to fight for Francis's vacated belt, over either Jones or Gane.... anyone saying different is a casual, a ufc shill, or an idiot.  Jones had never fought at HW... why give him a shot over the HW goat?  Gane had accomplished nothing at HW and had also just lost to Francis after being awarded the BS interim belt.... how the fuck was he more deserving than the HW goat?
  
    Lastly, how the fuck is anyone going to talk shit about Stipe not being worthy, after all the talk about gane being the greatest striker in the HW division and gane being more worthy to fight for Francis's vacated belt than Stipe.... after watching gane go on and lose to jones as pathetically as he did.  Kinda seems to me like all those people who were promoting gane as being better than Stipe, should go crawl back under a rock and stfu.

    Jones has 0 desire to fight the rightful number 1 contender
  
    That says all you need to remember whenever people talk about Jones moving up and being the HW GOAT too lol. Just wait, its coming.
