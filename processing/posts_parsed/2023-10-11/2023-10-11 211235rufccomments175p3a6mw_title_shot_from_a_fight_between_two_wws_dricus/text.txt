he's also not a mw fighter wtf lol he beats khamzat (also only 1 mw fight on his entire record) and he gets the title shot over DDP who just starched whittaker??? what the fuck? other way around makes no sense either. WW fighter making what is essentially his MW debut and he gets a title shot off of beating the #1 welter weight?



Am I high on crack or is this not totally insane?
