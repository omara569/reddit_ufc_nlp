Is Usman being 185 champion in any universe of yours?

We are in the universe where DeSean is a champ so anything can happen around here.

I wasn’t in a universe where I expected GSP to become the 185 champ. This world’s timeline has been incredibly wild for several years now.

He said he can’t retire on a loss because it sets a bad example for his daughter, but going on a Tyrone Woodley type downfall is even worse. If he loses to Khamzat and it’s brutal, I hope he retires. If he wins and looks somewhat like Nightmare Usman, he’ll beat Strickland to become MW champ.

I think Usman beats Khamzat. I get that he is older and on a losing streak but he was #1 pfp not that long ago. Khamzat is a beast but Burns showed that he is just a human. And I think Usman beats that human.

I wonder if either one of them is going to try to use their wrestling, or if it's just going to be a Burns/Chimaev style brawl. If it ends up being a brawl, call me crazy but I favour Usman there.

Honestly… weirder things have happened in MMA.

Firstly we don’t really know if Usman has fallen off. Edwards might just have his number, or Edwards is the second coming. Neither have fought anyone else since they first fought.

Secondly, it’s two wins. One against a relatively unproven prospect, and one against a champion who has lost plenty of fights. There’s every chance that in 6 months time Usman is the champ.

Funny how some people theorized about his fight with Jan at 205 after their backstage face off :)

Tbh after Usman decimates that absolute goof chimaev and gets the title shot, in all honesty he'll probably best Strickland and take it. Idk if he'd be able to beat Izzy tho if Izzy gets the next shot after. That is if Izzy is able to fix his game, Usman will take it if he even looks close to how he did against Strickland. I'd love to see that fight tho
