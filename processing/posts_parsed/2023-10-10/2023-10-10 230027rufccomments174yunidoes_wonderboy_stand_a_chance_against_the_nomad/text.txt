    Wonderboy stands a chance against everyone in the division lol, if he lands a clean head kick its night night

    A better question is: How long a forty-year-old Wonderboy will survive with someone who has very good wrestling?

    He has a chance for sure, better than people are giving him. Shavkat could come in with an ego and try to strike and get KOâ€™d

    The more interesting question to me is if wonderboy wins does he deserve a title shot? Or maybe a #1 contender fight?

    If the fight stays on the feet and Shavkat doesn't initiate any grappling or clinching, then yes.

    Stands a chance, yes. Gonna win? No.
