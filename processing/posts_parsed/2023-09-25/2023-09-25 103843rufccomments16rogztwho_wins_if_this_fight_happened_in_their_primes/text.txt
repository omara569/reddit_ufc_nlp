    Great fight but I think Conor catches him, Tony quite often got in trouble in his fights and I don’t think you could get away with making mistakes against prime Conor.

    Facts. It’s a shame he went downhill after the Mayweather fight.

    Probably tony, would just take him down or he would gas him out across 5 rounds

    Tony has 2 TDs since 2015, his style wasnt takedowns, he wouldve traded with McGregor

    how would Tony Ferguson vs Eddie Alvarez go? would he have destroyed Eddie the same way Conor did, or would it have been closer⁉️

    Conor's a sniper and Tony's a pressure machine. I can see Tony staying in his face and gassing Conor out. Conor could drop prime Tony with that left hand no doubt, but once down Tony again has the advantage.
  
    Tony takes it imo. Wish we'd had this instead of may/mac. Tony was the uncrowned champ while Khabib was still coming up.

    Plays out similar to Conor's first fight with Nate. He lands some good shots on Tony early, Tony eats them, starts landing shots of his own as Conor fades, Conor turns into a panic wrestler and gets submitted.

    Tony all day. Would've made him gas just how Diaz put it on Conor except much worse imo. There's a reason Conor avoided taking that fight.

    Prime Tony is on a 12 fight win streak, killed everyone in LW. Not someone who got choked by Nate Diaz
