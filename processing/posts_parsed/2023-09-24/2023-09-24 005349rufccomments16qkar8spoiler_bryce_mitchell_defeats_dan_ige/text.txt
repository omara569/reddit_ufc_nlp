    100% agree. The transitions were amazing just like him sliding position to position leaving no gaps. But what a fuckin trip haha

    Dan got robbed imo. Unanimous is crazy for no damage and control time. The sub attempts weren't near as threatening as Dan's shots. Bryce basically had one eye. I wouldn't have said robbery if it was split but 30 27? Come on

    Weird, I thought damage is the deciding factor on who wins

    Even if it was, the only major damage Ige dealt was round 1 (where he dealt a lot of dmg but also didn't deserve a 10-8). Last 2 rounds were pretty clearly Mitchell imo
