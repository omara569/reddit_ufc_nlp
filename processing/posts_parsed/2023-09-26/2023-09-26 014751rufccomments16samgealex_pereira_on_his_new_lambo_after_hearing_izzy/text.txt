Pereira is a recovering alcoholic, he doesn’t drink

That's also not a lambo if we're being pendantic

A new lambo would cost you like $500,000…wonder how much he has made from the past few fights

Almost certainly more than that. 287 probably sold A LOT. Estimated PPV buys is 800k so that’s a shit ton of money in PPV points+champ money

Yeah but Periera could prolly resell it for more since he owned it

Silly joke. It would be another W if the photo showed Alex driving and NOT drinking. Only idiots like Adesanya drink and drive.

izzy provided a BAC of 0.087.... which is insane because the test usually happens hours after being pulled over, and most likely hours after he started drinking. Izzy is not a small man by any means, at 90 kg or more. He most likely had 6-8 drinks and drove, which has no justification no matter how much izzy fans want to spin it. His fans and Izzy himself want everyone to believe that he just downed a couple of beers and began driving, which is still bad, but omits the true nature and severity of his crime

6-8 drinks are way too much, don’t forget he is Chinese and has alcohol intolerance.
