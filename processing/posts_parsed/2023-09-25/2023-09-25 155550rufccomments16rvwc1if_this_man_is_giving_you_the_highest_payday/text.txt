If this man is giving you the highest payday youâ€™re ever going to get in your life, you shut up, put on a show and take a beating. I know Dana is an ass but Francis is also a diva

    Man I remember the Margarito loaded glove incident, I think he put like some kind of cement or plaster and with the sweat it would harden, I remember Cottos face was a wreck when they fought. Has there ever been a loaded glove controversy in MMA?
  
    I remember Andy Ristie for Glory had a incident.

    Cotto was never the same after that fight. It's embarrassing that Margarito wasn't banned from the sport for life, and didn't have criminal charges pressed against him.

    Wraps and gloves are put on with a member of the opponents team watching in boxing.

    Francis when he doesn't talk:
  
    "Hes an idiot, he can't promote himself, he'll never be able to make money"
  
    Francis when he does talk
  
    "Hes a diva"
  
    Also with all due respect, tyson fury is also getting a massive payday without having to fight a real boxer. It's not like this only benefits Francis. I'm sure fury isn't upset about the fact that he doesn't have to fight usyk

    A lot of people are still angry because they were hoping he would fail and fall apart after he walked out of the UFC. Instead, he won. Now he's getting the fight he wants and gets a huge payday. We don't expect him to win the actual boxing match, but he will get paid very well. He won.
