UFC better have a backup in place just in case Costa damages his elbow in training before the fight. No way his elbow is 100% and if he's still training hard like he said yesterday it's def not gonna recover before the fight.

    It looks like Vettori is getting ready for next week as a backup.

    Vettori has a submission grappling match in abu dhabi one day before the UFC event

    Hopefully he's ready, because he's pretty much the only MW In the division that's Intrigued enough to fight Khamzat (as he stated In his pre-fight press conference before he fought Cannonier), while also being the only MW not booked for a fight yet In the Top 5.
  
    Izzys dealing with his legal Issues Involving his drunk driving accident, DDP Is probably fighting Strickland for the belt, Cannonier is fighting Dolidze this December, and Whittaker doesn't want to risk his spot fighting an unranked fighter In Khamzat.
  
    So If they need a backup for this fight If Paulo pulls out (Which he probably will), Vettoris gonna be the likely choice here.

    I listened to the Ariel interview from last night, I say the chances of him pulling out are 80%

    This will honestly be one of the biggest disappointments of the year if he pulls out, especially if the fight is cancelled altogether. Weâ€™ve been waiting over a year for Khamzat to fight and he finally gets booked against a big name fighter like Costa, only for it to fall apart.

    Costa played it well, if the doctors don't let him fight he will say that it's not his fault, he wants to fight and would easily beat Chimaev, and if he will be allowed to fight and loses he will say that during the fight he suddenly felt an injury and that's why he lost.

    I don't know what you guys expected him to do, not have the operation and potentially die from infection?
