This is the entirety of Paulo Costa’s career in the UFC since March 2017, well over six years ago

    I honestly feel like he fell out of love with fighting.

    Sucks that Yoel fight might just be the peak of his career.

    This doesn't even take into account all the canceled bouts he pulled out of or refused after they were announced.
  
    Also, a lot of people gloss over the Marvin weight issue. Two days before the weigh-in, Costa came out and said he's not going to make 185. Marvin said he didn't care about the weight and would fight at 195. Then Costa couldn't even make 195, and the fight was moved again to 205. Then Costa lost the fight. Completely unprofessional and selfish. It's so weird how he barely gets any hate for this. Everyone talks about how Wonderboy didn't get paid because his opponent was unprofessional, but Costa is that unprofessional opponent who has had his opponent lose out on a paycheck numerous times.

    I mean that’s slightly more than 1 fight per year. Fulfilling his contractual obligations. Seems kinda okayish.
