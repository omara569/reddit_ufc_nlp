If this man could beat Izzy so badly just imagine what he would do to Silva, Sean might just be the best middleweight ever in terms of actual fighting ability

I'm just happy Strickland cracked the MMA conundrum and showed that the superior art in MMA is throwing the first two punches you learn in boxing over and over and over.

This is the same Strickland that got knocked silly in the first by Pereira, right? I feel that's more indicative of what Silva would do to him than what we saw with Adesanya

Alright, let’s not get crazy here pal. Gotta see him fight a few more high ranked guys before we even start putting him up for discussion

There are far too many differences between the way Izzy and Anderson fight to assume Sean would starch Silva as well. Izzy has the better footwork, feints and diversity of his kicks but Anderson has superior head movement and far better hands than Izzy which probably makes it a tougher matchup for Sean stylistically. This is without discussing grappling whatsoever.

Whilst the greatest fighters are often well rounded enough or have the ability to adjust on the fly, the saying "styles make fights" is true.

I like Sean a lot but what Anderson achieved is far beyond what Izzy has ever done in this sport and they shouldn't be compared. There is no comparison other than them both being elite strikers.

Silva would have knocked Strickland out in the first.

Styles make fights so this wouldn’t make any sense.
