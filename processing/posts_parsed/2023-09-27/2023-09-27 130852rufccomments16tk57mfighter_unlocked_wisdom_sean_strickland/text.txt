Irony that this is being said in that room where every single of those idiots do exactly what Sean is saying not to do.

That awkward moment when you made an entire business empire off flexing your lavish lifestyle and preying on the insecurities of young men, only to have your guest reject that entire ideology and promote true growth from within.

That’s why this guy is looking at him like that. “Bruh, you are making us look stupid.”

If you watch the whole thing, he literally calls them moralless men, smut peddlers, and tells one of them that he has no respect for him because of his antics.

The nelk boys are cucks. This message flew through both ears and nothing will change for Kyle and the other weird guy on his podcast.

Sean is right but those kids he's talking to are exactly that, just kids and also they are rich already

Maybe I’m looking at this shit too seriously, but I’m in college and a decent amount of people want to be just like these guys and I don’t think they’re the best people to model yourself after. Hoping it’s just a phase cause I feel like in a few years these guys will be irrelevant

Nelk boys look so lost in what he's trying to say lol.

I am pleasantly surprised by Strickland recently. Thought he was a buffoon before, but he seems to genuinely care about society, especially young men.
