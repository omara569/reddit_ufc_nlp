Does anybody else feel like this is stylistically an easy matchup for Poatan? Not saying Jiri is an easy fight for anybody but that dude is so, so hittable… leaving his hands down and blitzing often. We saw how much he got pieced up by old man Glover. If he doesn’t fight a little more reserved and defense-minded, it’s hard to imagine an outcome other than KO by Poatan. Thoughts??? Feels like an easy path to another title for Alex.A real discussion on Jiri vs Alex

    Both of them get hit a lot ,more offence less defence.  I would give more of advantage to jiri just bc he’s young,wild,durable,also. I think his wild style will confuse poatan ,maybe just like how adesanya was confused with Strickland.

    Alex is also open to getting hit. He's also not going to have the same sort of power at LHW than he did at MW. I'd argue that Jiri has the power advantage here

    Of course he has the power at LHW.

    That makes no sense. Alex has some of his best KOs at LHW in kickboxing. If anything his power would be more at LHW from not having to cut as much. He catches Jiri with a left hook or clobbers him with a knee to the face.

    Maybe. But Jiri could take him down and sub him with very little resistance so... yeah. But if you feel like that won't happen put the rent on Poatan I guess

    Jiri’s wild style is what makes this fun, but yeah there is a high possibility Jiri gets KOd but I can also see him KO Alex or sub him

    this "Jiri has no defense" is getting old. You guys keep pointing that out for every upcoming fight and how he's gonna get KOd by whoever he's fighting this time.
  
    Jiri really has no defense but somehow always wins via some weird shit.
