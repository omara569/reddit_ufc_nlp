TOP 5 P4P FIGHTERS IN UFC.

    PFP is purely a marketing tactic.
  
    Volk was #1 before the Yair fight so they could advertise him as #1 PFP. This was even after he lost to Islam.
  
    They moved Jones up to #1 to promote the Stipe fight.
  
    After Jon retires, they will move Volk back to #1 even if Islam destroys Oliveira again. They want to promote Volk as #1 before the Ilia fight.

    how do they rate P4P ? is there a specfic criteria they have to fufil ?Islam has only defended once, Jon hasn't defended at all, charles lost and Leon only defended once against Usman. I just can't see how Volk wouldn't be number 1, Jon was out for so long and he really only beat Gane

    P4P is entirely bullshit to sell fights. Every time a big fight comes up they shift numbers around

    If Colby beats Leon are they really going to make Colby #4? If Leon loses to Colby does he drop off the p4p list altogether?
