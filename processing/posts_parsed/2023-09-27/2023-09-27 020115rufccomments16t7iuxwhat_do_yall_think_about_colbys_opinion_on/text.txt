Sean is honest to fault

I donâ€™t take anything Colby days seriously heâ€™s a fundamentally dishonest person idgaf if heâ€™s a persona or not, heâ€™s a ðŸ¤¡

Colby Covington is a character played by Colby Covington the person. So to answer your question, I donâ€™t take any notice of opinions of a written character. Itâ€™s like asking what I think of Roman Reigns opinion of Sean Strickland.
