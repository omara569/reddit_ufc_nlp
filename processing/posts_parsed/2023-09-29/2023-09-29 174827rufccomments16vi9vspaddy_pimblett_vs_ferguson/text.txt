Paddy Pimblett vs Ferguson
I mean what paddy can really gain from this fight ? No one wants to see Tony fights again , everyone want him to quit. Is there any fans to be gained for paddy after this fight ? I’m not a ufc fighter but I would stay away from Ferguson matchups, it’s just pointless.

It's done as a way to get ranked for Paddy. He ain't beating anybody else.

Nobody truly wins in this fight and I hate that this matchup exists
