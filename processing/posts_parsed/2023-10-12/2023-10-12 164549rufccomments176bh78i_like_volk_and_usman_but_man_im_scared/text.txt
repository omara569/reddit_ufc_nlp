I'm guessing the record for fighters with 10 or less days notice is not that great in title fights, or any fight for that matter.

Volks ready. Heâ€™s been waiting for this. He stated when he was going to get his surgery that he would be in Abu Dhabi ready to fight either Islam or Olives if one of them were to pull out.

I do however think we will see a different fight than the first match. I donâ€™t think we will see Islam standing there and trying to exchange with him as much this time. While I do think Islam looked a bit better striking last time itâ€™s just not what he was focusing his training on in this camp. I think we will see a lot more clinch work where Islam works trips to get the take down and go for the submission. Volk will definitely do well defending these he has a very high fight IQ so it will be interesting to see how long he can handle the pressure for.

The thing is feel like they both may take Wâ€™s here. How insane would that be.

Usman maybe, Volk... Highly unlikely. Although if he pulls it off, that would be one for the history books.
