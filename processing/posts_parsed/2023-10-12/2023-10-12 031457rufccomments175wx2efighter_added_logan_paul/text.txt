    I think that would be good for the UFC honestly. It gives them a bigger platform. As annoying as he is, he has an audience. You canâ€™t say he devalues the product as we already have some fighters that act like him (Oâ€™Malley)

    Just because Oâ€™Malley smokes weed, has funky hair, and plays around on the internet, doesnâ€™t mean he acts like the guy who took a piss on ancient sacred burial grounds, not to mention all the other generally actual gross shit heâ€™s done

    I want this solely to have him be McGregor's comeback tune up fight. Would be fucking hilarious either way it goes.
  
    We'd either get to watch McGregor beat up a Paul brother, or Logan beats him and he retires.
  
    And Jake Paul has to cope with the fact his brother got the chance to fight McGregor and not him.
