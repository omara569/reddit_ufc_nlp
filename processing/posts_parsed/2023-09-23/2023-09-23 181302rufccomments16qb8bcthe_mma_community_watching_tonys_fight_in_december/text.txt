    If he can’t beat Paddy, he should be forced to retire. Fucking fire him at that point. Dude has no more business being in that cage

    The fight he can actually win, if he cant win against Paddy, then please just retire, no CSO,

    I feel like Bobby Green was the final straw. Chandler and Diaz are never an easy fight no matter where or when it goes down, but Bobby Green didn’t even look as good as he has in the past, and still kept control of the fight in every moment except that knockdown. Paddy is definitely a worse overall striker then Green, but by this point, I feel like a guy with Paddy’s chin, power, age, and athleticism regardless of technical ability will just be too much for Tony to handle. The dudes’ chin and muscle definition has just declined so much…

    I’m probably a delusional Tony fan but I think he was doing good against Bobby even dropped him till Bobby straight up poked him in the eye on purpose, could’ve been an entirely different fight if that didn’t happen
