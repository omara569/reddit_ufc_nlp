It's mind-blowing he didn't consult the internet before making this move.

The amount of people acting like they can pass judgement on this is ridiculous.

Everyone who says i have left the country, that i have left Sweden and all this stuff, i have just moved to Dubai. Come to Dubai Habibi.

Everyone has made the biggest political thing out of this. Its better for my career, better training, always sunny, you're not freezing.

Will always respect my city, Stockholm, my home and i will always come back. Im doing stuff for my career, my family, its more important for me than anything else in the world. Everyone who cheers me on from Sweden, i respect you, I represent you too.

Good for him, and I don't know why anyone would take that as a knock on Sweden, if anything it's great the country is so easy to move around from.

Im from Sweden. Completely understand his decision.

Khamzat was treated like shit by Swedes. Everytime he was wrote about and shared on Swedish sites on social media labeled ”Swedish mma fighter” every post had a ”yeah right Swedish” with a lot more insults with 100x more people liking that comment than the post. They critized and made fun of him every single day. He never was a Swede to Swedish people. That was always a bad joke everyone laughed at. He had absolutely zero support from Swedes, only from other immigrants. And now when he pays taxes somewhere else where they appriciate him, all of the sudden he is a ungrateful mf that should represent Sweden lol.

If he was supported, respected and treated like Gustafsson, maybe things would have been different. Not a big suprise.
