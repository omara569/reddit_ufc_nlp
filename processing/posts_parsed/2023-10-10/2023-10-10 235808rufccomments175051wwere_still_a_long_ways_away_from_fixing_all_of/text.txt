We're still a long ways away from fixing all of MMA's problems, but this feels like a good start.
Hopefully it becomes a nationwide thing soon.

    Would love to learn more. How does this retirement fund work? Is it like social security? I imagine the challenge is getting enough funds inside it to pay out any substantial amount?

    I'm sure the additional tax on MMA event ticket sales will lure more promoters to host MMA events in California lol
  
    Each fighter needs at least 39 CSAC sanctioned scheduled rounds to qualify. It's a nothing burger
  
    On a side note, huge opportunity for a reservation to host MMA events that are not CSAC sanctioned
