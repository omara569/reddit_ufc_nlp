Contaminated Supplements
This is a perfect example of athletes unwittingly taking banned substances or PEDs. Opened and unopened bottles of the supplement he took were tested and both were found to be contaminated. It sucks because he already popped once but this time is no fault of his own.        A lot of supplements aren't regulated and have their ingredients sourced from China which is known to cut corners when it comes to quality control.        So much so that Canada has banned or suggested their professional athletes not us an supplements from the US.
