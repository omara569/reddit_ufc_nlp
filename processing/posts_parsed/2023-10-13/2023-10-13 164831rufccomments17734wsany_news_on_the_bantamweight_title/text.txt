Anyone heard any news about the bantamweight title? If you do, please drop a link because I’ve heard a whole lot of nothing.        Before the Bueno Silva fight, I thought for sure it’d be Pennington/Holm 3 for the title since everyone else in the top five are on short streaks, and while it’s sad to see The Preacher’s Daughter lose another main event, but I think Pennington/Bueno Silva is a much better the match for the vacant title. But does anyone else have a better match up for it?        Peña and Aldana are both coming off complete shut-out losses to Nunes, who’s gone. Vieira is coming off a win, but lost to Pennington right before that, and Holm just lost to Bueno Silva.        If anyone’s heard news about a match up being agreed on, or an approximate date for the vacant title, drop a link to i, pleaseAny News on the Bantamweight Title?

    Rousey Vs O’Malley for the true undisputed Bantamweight Title. 2 million ppv buys

    Rousey’s been away from proper competition for too long. The sport’s moved on without her. She might have a chance with O’Malley on the ground but I don’t know if she has the power to take him down, and I highly doubt she has the boxing acumen over O’Malley to get a knockdown

    Nah man, where’s the 155/170 women’s title? I wanna see the Amazon’s throwing hands and feet.

    A 155lb weight class would be fun. We know the PFL manages to find talent for their Lightweight division, so I don’t see why the UFC wouldn’t … also don’t know why the UFC had such a hard time finding talent for Featherweight, but that division is dead for now, sadly

    I've heard nothing. The only rumors I had heard was a potential Ronda Rousey comeback but those rumors were quickly shot down. Basically silence regarding the matter. Haven't heard as much as speculation. I wouldn't be surprised if they were saving it for UFC 300 so they can stack 3 title fights on it or something.

    I don’t hate the idea of the vacant title being up for grabs on the 300 card, but it’s weird that we haven’t heard anything more concrete about bantamweight yet. Title been properly vacant since June. Effing fuck is that?

    Shevchenko should move up

    I like schevchenko for a bantamweight fight, but I think she’s gonna be on her vengeance quest against grasso for a while
