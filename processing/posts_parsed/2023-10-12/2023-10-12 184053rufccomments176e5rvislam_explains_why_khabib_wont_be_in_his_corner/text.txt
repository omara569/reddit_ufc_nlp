Islam explains why Khabib won't be in his corner at UFC 294.

    A totally understandable and respectable move, but if I was on that team and we had one guy fighting one of the p4p best I would understand making an exception.

    Yeah It would've been amazing to see him on Islams corner but I also understand him treating his whole team equally. Also, Khabib didn't corner his cousin Usman who fought last week so him cornering Islam now would be weird.

    Itâ€™s almost like heâ€™s a prize fighter getting ready for a big bout
  
    Remember when people thought Conor was going to sleep khabib because khabib had a black eye on his right eye meaning heâ€™d be hit with left hands during training
