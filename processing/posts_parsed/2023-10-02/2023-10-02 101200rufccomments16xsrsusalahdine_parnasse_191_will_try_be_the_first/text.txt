I enjoy it, they just let those fellas juice to the gills, and they be packing stadium shows. Gamrot was there, Jan so they produce some good talent.

Not gonna pretend itâ€™s as respected as ONE or PFL, but KSW is legit Europeâ€™s most watched promotion. Donâ€™t knock it so quick dude.

So the Parnasse guy started at Featherweight or something?

He usually fights at FW. Thats him with Cedric Doumbe (welterweight)
