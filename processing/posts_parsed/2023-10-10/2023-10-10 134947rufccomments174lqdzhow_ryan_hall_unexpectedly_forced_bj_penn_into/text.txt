    that was such a sweet moment.Im a bjj fan, I like listening to Joe Rogan ... but damn when Hall tried that shit for the 100th time, and Joe still defended him ... seeing him getting ko'd was pure bliss

    I never understood all the hate Hall got for that
  
    He broke his hand in like the first round, whatd people want him to do? and also he was fighting against Ilia who is a freakin monster and fighting for the championship

    Tbf, beating him wasn’t gonna push you up the rankings much, and losing meant a possible knee injury, so I doubt people were jumping at the opportunity to fight him. Not because he was dominant, but because there wasn’t much to gain.

    And people are also saying that Ilia will get wrestlefucked by Volk forgetting about the fact that Ilia is also an outstanding grappler. They will most likely brawl it out when they fight.

    hear me out. when hall was ranked, it was not worth the risk for most ranked fighters to take a fight with him. do with that information what you will.

    Turning that way to defend a backside 50/50 hurts my knee just thinking about it

    Very interesting thanks for the perspective. Really shows the levels to this. As someone who is just a “cAsUAl” it’s very cool to see this process slowed down. Gives you an appreciation for it.

    It's wild to see Penn (who is a fifth degree black belt in BJJ) do the EXACT thing they tell you not to do when someone is going in for that sort of heel hook.
