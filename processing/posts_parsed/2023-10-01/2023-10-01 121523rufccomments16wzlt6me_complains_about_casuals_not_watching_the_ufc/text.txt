    Boxing undercards are always garbage

    Fr that’s because the undercards are almost always no names.
  
    My first ever mma fight live was Chandler vs Poirier and I was like “wait isn’t this the undercard? Aren’t these guys popular fighters? Why are they fighting on the undercard?”
  
    This is because in boxing any guy with any kind of popularity headlines a card. This is why I never watch boxing anymore, why pay 80 dollars for one fight when I could buy a ufc ppv for the same price and get 5 good fights!

    Problem is that the undercards are usually not really sold or marketed to the public, I think if UFC hired some freelancer editors/video makers.. they could have made such a huge outreach with some of these great upercommers
  
    As every other business, they are just looking for that cash cow and don't give a damn about anyone else

    the ugas beatdown was actually the best fight last night. then the lubin fight sucked all the energy out of the room and the canelo fight was kinda boring too

    Boxing is way different. The prelims are laughable. In MMA there’s much better fights

    During the Yordenis Ugas vs. Mario Barrios fight ( which was only 2 fights before Canelo ) the arena was shockingly empty. Legit filled up right before the main event.

    True but boxing is painfully boring to watch so it makes sense. God 36 minutes per fight is brutal to try to sit through.

    No such thing as casuals anymore. They made it so hard to be a fan. Have to pay a membership to be allowed to pay for a ppv. Or find a shitty illegal stream. What a dumb business model.

    PPV undercards are trash for boxing they just rely on the headliner its so frustrating as a huge boxing fan
