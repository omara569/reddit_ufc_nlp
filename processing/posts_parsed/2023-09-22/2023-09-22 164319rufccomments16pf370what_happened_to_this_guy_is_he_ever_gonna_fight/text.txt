What happened to this guy, is he ever gonna fight again?
It's been almost a year since Chris Barnett fought

    His fiancé or wife passed away so I’m sure he’s focused on that. But who knows truly

    His wife passed away, I’m sure he’s taking a break

    His last fight was the Best undercard fight in recent history.

    I’m surprised that fight didn’t get much clout, because Chris was rocked early. Definitely was a super size banger

    Agreed. One of the best heavyweight fights in the past decade too. Genuinely thought dude was fighting thru a stroke with the way his face and mouth looked

    I don’t know if I could come back at all if I lost my wife, so I’m praying for the dude.

    Whether he does or not. I hope the man is okay.
  
    He had to fight couple months after his wife died and him becoming a single father of 2.
  
    He has more important personal life matters to deal with than our entertainment. As long as he and his kids are good that should good enough for us.

    I don’t mean this as aggressively as it’s going to sound, but, lose your girlfriend/wife and try to perform on such a large stage. Go through a fight camp. Train in general. It’s gotta be so tough for him.
