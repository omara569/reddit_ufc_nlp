Who else got one of these
Who else has an emerald on their belt? And will we see them again or will the UFC change it back to red?

    I think it’s just for the 30th anniversary. Anyone with a successful title defense this year should get one, but they will likely switch back to ruby afterward.
  
    Rubies are more expensive than emeralds though, so who knows lol

    Why tf did he get a gem, shouldn’t he have gotten a second belt and third belt? He never successfully defended
