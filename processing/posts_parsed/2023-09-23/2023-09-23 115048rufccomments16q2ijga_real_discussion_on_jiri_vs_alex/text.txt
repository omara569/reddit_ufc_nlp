A real discussion on Jiri vs Alex
Does anybody else feel like this is stylistically an easy matchup for Poatan? Not saying Jiri is an easy fight for anybody but that dude is so, so hittable… leaving his hands down and blitzing often. We saw how much he got pieced up by old man Glover. If he doesn’t fight a little more reserved and defense-minded, it’s hard to imagine an outcome other than KO by Poatan. Thoughts??? Feels like an easy path to another title for Alex.
