Will Khamzat really have a size advantage? Usman is about 190lbs in the cage at ww. Out of camp he might get up to 200.

khamzat is just as big or bigger, i think he will still have his way and take usman down early. now if usman can survive round 1 and get khamzat tired, it'll be interesting when those takedowns aren't as easy and he's able to land some strikes of his own, like how gilbert was able to in round 2 against khamzat.

khamzat will have an advantage because he will show up 9 pounds overweight talking about "I don't fucking give a shit I fuck everybody"

Yeah, but that advantage didn't help him much against Burns. if Usmans knees don't fail him, I see him winning this.

Usman got dropped by burns and that was before being head kicked into the stratosphere, seems like dodgy reasoning to base a pick off

Usman by KO I'm calling it now.

Weight is just a number. What matters is how the fighter naturally carries that weight. Extra weight can definitely be a detriment.

so after this fight Khamzat gets a shot at strickland? doesnt make sense ... ufc all over the place trying to force these champs

i think the title shot was just their best effort in salvaging 294

Both Usman and Chimaev could be in the top. 5 at MW only other person you could put in to fight Strickland is DDP and he’s injured. It makes sense.
