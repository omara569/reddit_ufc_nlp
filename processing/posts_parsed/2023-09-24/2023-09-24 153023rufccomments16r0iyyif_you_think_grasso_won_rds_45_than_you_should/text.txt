If you think Grasso won rds 4&5 than you should also think Mitchell won that fight easily. Stop with the double standard bullshit for fighters you like vs don’t like.

    I think Grasso won round four because she drove her knee into Valentinas head about five times in a row and Valentina's only defense was touching the mat with her fingers and crying at Herb. But that's just me.

    According to an MMADecsisions 1600-person poll, the majority of viewers saw Round 4 go to Grasso.
  
    And that's the way I saw it as I was watching it live.  And that's the way Dom and Cormier called it live!  Those two said it was 2-2 after the fourth.
  
    Grasso finished Shevchenko in the first fight.  And then beat Shevchenko 3-2 in the second fight.  So beat her twice in a row and now has to fight her a third time!
  
    Is Shevchenko giving Uncle Dana some special favors on the side?  Seriously!  (You know Ronda was.)

    And you just ignore everything else Valentina did during that round right?

    He won, but he also has a pretty clear ceiling until he switches over to a legit MMA gym so he can clean up that awful striking.

    He just isn’t fast enough on the feet to ever be elite there.
  
    I think he was still a bit low on confidence in his striking after the Ilia fight, Ige is also a monster on the feet, I think he did pretty good all things considered. Ige landed a couple hard shots that did damage, but he wasn’t able to find Bryce most of the fight.
  
    The guy knocked down Barboza his striking isn’t that bad.

    Legit see the same dudes arguing that Grasso won by taking down Shev and threatening subs saying that Bryce should’ve lost because he took more damage.
  
    Legit had arguments with these dudes and they said the cut Shev opened up on Grasso in round 4 shouldn’t matter. But now that it’s Bryce the cut is all you need to see the damage.

    The damage the knees that Grasso landed were more impactful than the surface cut.  You can have cuts that bleed that aren't "impactful."
  
    I forget who it was but some analyst asked which would you rather have:  A surface cut or five knees to the head plus a body slam plus finishing the round threatening a heal hook?

    i thought Mitchell outworked Ige. i am 100% a mitchell hater. but he won. it was a close fight and Ige did his thang... i wish fights were scored better than just 10-9 system the use...
  
    if they found a better point/score system i think we would have less issues with final scores.
  
    a 30-27 fight can look a lot different between 2 fights which is what really bothers me
