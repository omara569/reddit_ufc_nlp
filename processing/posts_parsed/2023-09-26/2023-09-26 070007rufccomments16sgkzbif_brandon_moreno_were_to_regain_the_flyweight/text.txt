If Brandon Moreno were to regain the flyweight title then go on to win the Batam, feather, lightweight, welter, middle, light heavy, and heavyweight titles would he be considered the greatest of all time over guys like Jones and GSP?

    Just picturing Moreno at heavyweight is hilarious, you think heâ€™d look like Chris Barnett or Franco Columbo
