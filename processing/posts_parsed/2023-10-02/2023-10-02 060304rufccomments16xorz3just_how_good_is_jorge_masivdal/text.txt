Just how good is Jorge Masivdal?

I mean he’s so good that he fought Burns for 25 minutes in 15 minutes, that’s impressive in itself

If Jorge focussed on wrestling earlier in his career he would’ve been a much more lethal force.

Always been a big fan of his smooth boxing and striking. Great head movement.

Masvidal focusing on crotch-sniffing? That’s like Jon Jones trying to outlaw obliques

Masvidal is a really good fighter, it's just that his weakness has always been his wrestling/ground game. That said, if that knee hadn't beautifully landed on Askrens face, he would have had a hard time in that fight.

He actually has decent TDD but he was old and basically a lightweight and it showed

So good that he lost against burns

Khamzat was trying to make a statement against Gilbert, I don’t think he fought intelligently. I doubt we’ll see him so reckless against costa. Jorge is an excellent striker but his ground game was too weak for the top 5.

Jorge has top notch striking. Not  thr smoothest. Definitely not the best grappler. His size n age n years of fighting, especially in a smaller weight class probably was his big mistake for not getting a belt.

He's got very good submission defence I feel like

Infact he's just hard to finish in general, except Kamaru Usman randomly KO'ing him
