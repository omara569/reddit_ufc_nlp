Damn it's so close, what y'all think?
I think the timing and luck played into Colbys favor. He now has 10 rounds of tape to study of Leon vs Usman 2 & 3 and his own 10 rounds against Usman. This could be a significant advantage sitting out for a long time preparing for just 1 guy.        I'm convinced Sean would not beat Izzy if he did not lose to Alex first. The Alex fight sent him back to make adjustments on his striking defense to avoid getting KO'd again
