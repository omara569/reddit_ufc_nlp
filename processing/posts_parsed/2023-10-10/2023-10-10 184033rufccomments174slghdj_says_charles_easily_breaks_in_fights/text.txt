    Islam’s favorite sub is the arm triangle. I think charles just knew he wasn’t getting out with how deep it was.

    I would have gotten out pretty easy.
  
    With all the hair on my neck, Cheeto dust and acne oil Islam would have slipped straight off.

    Wasn’t there something in MMA news about how this arm triangle actually tore a muscle or something in Charles neck? No doubt that shit was tight af

    Oh yeah, if I got rocked and I had gorilla Islam on full mount choking me I'd tap sooner lol, I don't feel like this was a 'give up' moment We've seen Charles change from giving up when he's nearly been finished by Chandler, Gaethje etc

    Charles finished Chandler, Dustin, and Justin just because they were afraid to continue on the ground. Especially Justin. He knocked him down multiple times, and just waited him to get up. Islam can strike Charles, knock-down Charles, and sub Charles. Because he isn't afraid of his ground game.

    Olivera at 145 gave up a lot and very fast, look at his losses

    There’s plenty of evidence of Charles mentally breaking throughout his career tbh
