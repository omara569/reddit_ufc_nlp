    The Kape State Athletic Commission has reviewed it on appeal, and the result has been overturned to a No Contest.

    I see nothing wrong with this. If he legitimately feels like he won the fight he lost due to judges don’t we all understand that? It happens sometimes the judges get it wrong. I haven’t even seen that fight personally so maybe he’s wrong. But I see nothing wrong with convincing yourself you never lost. Is a split decision loss on a judges scorecard really a loss? Sometimes it isn’t. Sometimes you feel you won anyway.

    Exactly, if Dominic Reyes felt that way for example it would be completely understandable to me.
  
    Everybody is entitled to their own opinion, as long as you don't take credit away from the opponent who won it's not disrespectful.
