    Tony looked lost against Nate. So I have little hope for him.

    It’s pretty clear what they are trying to do, but let’s hope it blows up in Dana’s face. But man I hate to say this, but I think it’s a pretty close fight

    Exactly what I was thinking. Tony needs to be forced to retire. It's sad that he has come this.

    Tony needs to retire. He had one of the worst lucks in the world in his UFC career and got shafted by Dana hard during his prime, there are younger, better, stronger guys coming up and he deserves to leave a better legacy than being a stepping stone.

    The ufc doesn’t want to have another Molly situation, so they picked the best match up possible to rebuild the hype around Paddy. Dana white privilege at its finest.

    Indifferent. Paddy gets a big name. Tony gets a decent cheque. The cycle continues.
