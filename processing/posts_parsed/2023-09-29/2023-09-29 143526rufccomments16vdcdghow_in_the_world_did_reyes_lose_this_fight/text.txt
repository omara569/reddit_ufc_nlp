Never seen a fighter come so close to reaching the mountain top before sliding back down to the valley like Reyes.

Marlon Moraes

Except he slid thousands of feet underground and was covered with rubble and debris

He won that shit too. Crazy fight. Sucks it was in Houston bc I think vegas would’ve scored differently. Ya never know though. Great fight regardless

This is the fight that broke Reyes. After losing to him he was never the same, a bit like Tony/Gaetjhe

Reyes was mentally broken while Tony was physically

To be fair,  I don't know of anybody who could eat a spinning elbow from Jiri like the one that was landed. I do agree that Reyes career has taken a hit since jbj, though.

Edit a word

Judges have been dictating the UFC for so long. It’s been real bad this year.

This fight is one of those where the more you watch it the more you see how close it actually was. I still think Reyes won the fight but it was so close that giving it to Jon really wasn’t an awful decision looking back on it. Also imagine if Reyes actually got that decision where his career would be at right now. I think that decision fucked his mind up big time

Close decisions typically favor the champ too

Agreed that it was much closer than people make it out to be. Reyes had a ton of flurries that did not land clean but the crowd noise and jones backing up made it seem like he was getting pieced up live. That being said, I think reyes rightfully should’ve won the first three. I do think jones would win this fight 9 out of 10 times, but he shouldn’t have won that night.

I do think mma fans just need to let it go though. This is far from the worst judges decision to have ever taken place and no other decision is harped on as much as this one
