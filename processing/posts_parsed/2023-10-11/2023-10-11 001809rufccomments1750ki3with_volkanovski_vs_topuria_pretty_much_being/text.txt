With Volkanovski vs Topuria pretty much being confirmed for 297 should the 298 main event be Sean Strickland vs Dricus Du Plessis?

    Should it be? Yes. Will it be? No.
  
    A Izzy rematch is the money fight, so that's what it'll be.

    I think that was the plan before but now that Dana saw all the hate against it he seemed to be way less into doing it when he was asked about it at a press conference.
